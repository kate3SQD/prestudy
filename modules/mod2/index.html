  "articleBody": "Section 1: Anatomy Section one of this module will cover human anatomy.\nThis section will introduce anatomic terms and definitions, and provide an overview of skeletal and muscular anatomy.\nDefinitions \u0026 Terminology Anatomy is the science of the structure of the human body.\nThere are many systems that comprise the human body. This section will provide an overview of the skeletal and muscular systems.\nIt is important to possess basic knowledge of human anatomy in order to design safe and effective exercise programs.\nAnatomic Position Anatomy begins with an understanding of the anatomic position.\n In the anatomic position, the body is standing tall, the feet are positioned hip-width apart, the arms are to the side with palms facing forward, and the head and eyes are looking directly ahead. The anatomic position often serves as the point of reference from which structures of the body are named or located relative to other body parts.  Anatomic Planes With some exceptions, the anatomic position also serves as the point of reference for movements of the body.\nThe body moves in three dimensions, each of with are defined by a specific plane of motion.\nA plane is a flat, level surface extending into space. The three basic planes of motion include the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes.\nA specific movement of the body will occur in one or more of these planes of motion.\nImagine a plane to be much like a large pane of glass such as that found in a window.\n  The sagittal plane bisects the body into the right and left sides through the vertical midline or median of the body.\n A movement in the sagittal plane travels parallel to the plane, but does not cross it. Movement in the sagittal plane travels forward and backward.  For example, from the anatomic position, flexion and extension movements typically occur in the sagittal plane of motion. Some resistance training exercises that occur primarily in the sagittal plane include a biceps curl, triceps pushdown, seated leg curl, forward lunge, and narrow row. Each of these exercises involved flexion and extension at one or more joints.      The frontal plane divides the body into the anterior and posterior sides of the body.\n A movement in the frontal plane travels parallel to the plane, but does not cross it. Movement in the frontal plane travels toward or away from the sides of the body.  For example, from the anatomic position, abduction and adduction movements typically occur in the frontal plane of motion. Some resistance training exercises that occur primarily in the frontal plane include a lateral raise, side lunge, standing hip abduction, a lat pulldown, and a side bend.      The transverse plane is parallel to the ground and separates the upper and lower halves of the body.\n Since this plane is positioned horizontally, it is sometimes also called the horizontal plane. Movement in the transverse plane travels horizontally around a vertical axis of rotation. Transverse plane movements often involve rotation such as turning the head from side to side, rotating the torso, or internally and externally rotating the shoulder around the vertical axis of the humerus. Transverse plane movement also includes abduction and adduction of the arms across the body moving horizontal to the ground. Some resistance training exercises that occur primarily in the transverse plane include a dumbbell chest fly, a reverse fly, external rotation of the shoulder targeting the rotator cuff, and a wide row.    Terms of Position and Direction At this point, it is becoming evident that learning anatomy is like learning a new language. The following will review some additional terminology that are fundamental to the understanding of anatomy.\n  Anterior refers to the front of the body\n  Posterior refers to the back of the body\n  Lateral refers to location away from the midline or median of the body\n  Medial refers to a location toward the midline or median of the body\n For example, the outside of the knee is the lateral aspect; whereas, the inside of the knee is the medial aspect.    Proximal refers to a location closer to the center of the body, the attached end of a limb, or the origin of a muscle. Remember proximal as being in closer proximity to the center of the body.\n  Distal refers a location further away from the center of the body, the attached end of a limb, or the origin of a muscle. Think of distal as being a greater distance from the center of the body.\n For example, the ankle is located distal to the knee and the knee is located distal to the hip. Or the knee is proximal to the ankle and the hip is proximal to the knee.    Superior refers to a location above another body part and/or closer to the head\n  Inferior refers to a location below another body part and/or closer to the feet\n For example the shoulder is superior to the hip and the hip is inferior to the shoulder. Superior is synonymous with higher or above and inferior is synonymous with lower or below.    Skeletal Anatomy The human skeleton consists of 206 bones.\nThe functions of the skeletal system include:\n providing the supportive framework for the body protecting the vital organs and the central nervous system forming levers to produce movement with the muscular system storing minerals (e.g., calcium) producing red blood cells  The bones comprising the skeletal system can be broadly placed into two sets, the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton.\nDivisions of the Skeletal System The axial skeleton includes the 80 bones of the skull, spinal column, sternum, and ribs. The primary functions of the axial skeleton are to provide the main axial support for the body, to protect the central nervous system, and to protect the organs of the thorax.\n Remember: axial is the main body's axis.\nThe appendicular skeleton includes the remaining 126 bones of the upper and lower extremities including the shoulder complex and the pelvis.\n Remember: appendicular refers to the body's appendages (arms \u0026 legs)\nBone Tissue Bone tissue is soft at birth and hardens or ossifies as the skeleton matures into adolescence and young adulthood.\nSkeletal tissue is comprised of a collagen matrix, which gives bone flexible properties, and mineral content (i.e., calcium and phosphates), which provides the stiffness.\nThere are two types of bones: cortical bone and trabecular bone.\n Cortical or compact bone is found mainly in the long shafts of bones and accounts for about 80% of all bone tissue. Trabecular bone is a spongy tissue having a lattice or honeycomb structure, and is found in the vertebrae, pelvis, flat bones, and ends of long bones.  Bone is a dynamic tissue with the ability to grow and self-repair through a process called remodeling.\nBone Growth The bone matrix consists of three types of bone cells including osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes.\n Osteoclasts are bone-destroying cells that cause resorption of the bone tissue Osteoblasts are bone-building cells that stimulate the formation of new bone tissue Osteocytes are mature bone cells that help to regulate bone remodeling  Bone remodeling is a continuous process involving the coupled action of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, in which\n osteoclasts first resorb (i.e., breakdown) older bone and osteoblasts subsequently form and mineralize new bone.  During periods of growth and maturation, the activity of osteoblasts exceeds osteoclasts, so bones grow, increase mineral density, and gain strength. After peak bone mass is attained, typically in the mid-to-late twenties, the activity of osteoclasts gradually outpaces osteoblasts leading to a loss of bone mineral density and strength. The rate of bone loss is influenced by genetics, hormonal factors, dietary habits, and other lifestyle behaviors. If the loss of bone mineral density becomes significant, it may result in osteopenia or osteoporosis.\nCertainly it is not necessary to attempt to memorize the name and location of all 206 bones. However, it is important to learn the major bones of the skeletal system indicated below. These and other bones will be covered in this and other sections of this module.\n- Skull - Clavical - Scapula - Sternum - Ribs - Humerus - Radius - Ulna - Phalanges - Pelvis - Sacrum - Ischium - Femur - Patella - Fibula - Tibia - Calcanus  Connective Tissue Two types of connective tissue are also important with regard to both skeletal and muscular anatomy:\n Ligament is a fibrous connective tissue that attaches bone to bone, providing passive support to joints Tendon is a connective tissue that attaches muscle to bone, allowing for the transfer of muscular force to the skeletal system  Joints A joint (or articulation) is the junction between two or more bones.\nThere are three major types of articulations in the body.\nThese joint classifications include:\n Synarthrodial joints (also called fibrous) are held together by tough, fibrous connective tissue making them an immovable joint such as those found between suture joints of the skull. Amphiarthrodial joints (also called cartilaginous) are often connected by fibrocartilaginous tissue such as a pad or a disc, like the intervertebral discs found between the bodies of two adjacent vertebrae. Amphiarthrodial articulations are often slightly moveable joints. Diarthrodial joints (also called synovial) are freely movable joints and are the most common in the body.  These joints are also called synovial joints arising from their characteristic synovial membrane and the synovial fluid which lubricates the joint. Synovial joints also contain articular cartilage and a joint capsule. Examples of synovial joints within the human body include the shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee.    Joints are also classified by their structure and function…\n  Ball-and-socket joint is comprised of the ball-like head of one bone articulating into the cup-shaped socket of another bone, allowing for movement in all three planes of motion.\n The glenohumeral joint of the shoulder is an example of a ball-and-socket joint, where the head of the humerus articulates with the glenoid fossa of the scapula. The hip is another example of a ball-and-socket joint, with the head of the femur articulating with the acetabulum of the pelvis.    Condyloid joint resembles a reduced ball-and-socket configuration in which the oval-shaped surface of one bone articulates with the elongated or elliptical-shaped surface of another bone.\n Given the elliptical shape of a condyloid joint, it is also commonly referred to as an ellipsoid joint. Movement of condyloid joints occurs on two planes of motion allowing flexion-extension and adduction-abduction, but not rotation. Examples of condyloid joints include the wrist, the metacarpophalangeal or fingers joint, and the metatarsophalangeal or toe joints.    Hinge joint is comprised of the c-shaped surface of one bone articulating with the rounded-surface of another bone, allowing one bone to swing around the other like a hinge.\n Hinge joints allow movement in only one plane of motion represented by flexion and extension of the joint. Two examples include the hinge joint of the elbow and the knee.    Saddle joint is characterized by the convex surface of one bone sitting in the hollow or concave surface of another.\n Although a saddle joint is limited in its ability to rotate, it does allow for movements in the other two planes of motion. A somewhat rare example of a saddle joint is the carpal-metacarpal joint of the thumb.    Pivot joint allows only for rotational movement.\n This type of joint consists of the ring of a bone rotating around a process or projection of another bone. The first two cervical vertebrae, named the atlas and axis, respectively, form a pivot joint under the base of the skull, allowing the head to rotate from side to side.    Two opposing flat surfaces of adjacent bones move across one another creating a gliding joint.\n The inter-carpal joints of the hand and the inter-tarsal joints of the foot represent gliding joints.    The Spine The spinal or vertebral column consists of 33 bones, called vertebrae, which are categorized and named by region.\n There are seven cervical, twelve thoracic and five lumbar vertebrae. The sacrum is comprised of five fused vertebrae and the coccyx, also referred to as the ‘tailbone’ is comprised of four fused vertebrae.  Spinal Column The cervical spine consists of 7 vertebrae, which support the skull and neck.\n The first two cervical vertebrae are called the atlas (C1) and the axis (C2), which form a pivot joint allowing the head to rotate side to side.  The thoracic spine, consisting of 12 vertebrae, articulates the ribs to support the thorax.\nThe lumbar spine consists of the 5 largest vertebrae able to carry a significant portion of the body’s weight.\nThe 5 vertebrae of the sacrum fuse to form a single bone.\n The sacrum transmits body weight to the hip joints through articulation with the pelvic girdle, called the sacroilliac joints. The coccyx or ‘tailbone' consists of four fused vertebrae and is functionally insignificant.  Intervertebral Discs The bodies of two adjacent vertebrae are separated by a intervertebral disc.\n The outer portion of the disc is made of a several layers of tough fibrocartilaginous tissue with obliquely-oriented fibers called the annulus fibrosus. The center of the disc contains a jelly-like substance called the nucleus pulposus. The intervertebral discs serve an important function to absorb shock and dissipate ground reaction forces that arise from movements such as walking, running, and jumping. The tough fibrous tissue of the discs is quite resilient to these forces; however, it is not uncommon for acute and chronic injuries to occur. The cumulative effects of chronic poor posture and/or faulty lifting techniques may contribute to premature degeneration and weakening of the disc, eventually resulting in injury such as a bulge or disc herniation.  Additional intervertebral joints are formed at the superior and inferior facets, also called articular processes, located on the two transverse processes of each vertebra.\n These facet joints function to limit motion and protect the spine from excessive rotation, lateral flexion, and shearing forces. These joints may also become injured as the result of spinal instability, poor body mechanics or lifting techniques, and unsafe exercises.  The Shoulder Complex Anterior View Review the diagram of the anterior view of the shoulder complex.\nThe shoulder complex is comprised of three bones including the humerus, scapula, and clavicle.\n The shoulder, specifically the glenohumeral joint, is a ball-and-socket joint. The ball-shaped humeral head sits in or adjoins with the shallow, saucer-like socket of the scapula called the glenoid fossa. Because the head of the humerus is two-thirds larger than the glenoid fossa, the glenohumeral joint resembles a golf ball sitting on a tee.  A fossa is a broad shallow area of a bone.\n A fossa often serves as the attachment point for a muscle. For example, the subscapular fossa of the scapula is the origin of the subscapularis muscle. A fossa may also serve as an articulating surface with another bone, just as the glenoid fossa articulates with the head of the humerus.  A tubercle is a relatively small projection or bump on a bone.\n The greater and lesser tubercles are the insertion points on the humerus for the rotator cuff muscles.  A process is a relatively large or prominent projection on a bone, which also serves as the attachment point for muscles.\n For example, the acromion process and the coracoid process of the scapula.  Posterior View Review the diagram of the posterior view of the shoulder complex.\nFrom this view, you can see the supraspinous fossa, which is the point of origin for the supraspinatus muscle, and the infraspinous fossa, which is the origin of the infraspinatus muscle.\nMuscular Anatomy Classification Muscles of various types throughout the body serve different purposes.\nMuscle tissue is classified into one of three groups including cardiac, smooth, and skeletal.\n  The cardiac muscle tissue, which is found only in the heart, is extremely efficient, fatigue resistant, and well-adapted to maintain the ongoing pumping action of the heart.\n Cardiac muscle is involuntary since we do not maintain conscious control of this muscle action.    Another type of involuntary muscle is smooth muscle tissue, which lines the internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, as well as the blood vessel walls.\n Smooth muscle serves to move food through the digestive system and blood through the blood vessels.    The most abundant type of muscle in the human body is skeletal muscle tissue.\n Skeletal muscles are considered voluntary, since these muscles by and large are under our conscious control to accelerate or create movement, decelerate or slow movement, and stabilize or prevent movement. Skeletal muscle is primarily composed of water, which makes up ~75% of the muscle composition. Another ~20% of the muscle composition is contractile proteins and the remaining ~5% includes high-energy phosphates, key minerals, and energy sources needed for the production of force. There are well over 600 different skeletal muscles in the human body.    Composition Skeletal muscle consists of long, cylindrical cells called muscle fibers.\n Muscle fibers are bundled together into muscle fascicles. Each muscle fiber is comprised of hundreds to thousands of smaller, threadlike structures called myofibrils. Myofibrils are arranged parallel to each other and span the length of the muscle fiber.      A gelatin-like substance called the sarcoplasm surrounds the myofibrils.\n The mitochondria, known as the ‘powerhouse of a muscle fiber’, are found within the sarcoplasm. The energy needed to support aerobic activity is produced in the mitochondria.    The myofibrils are comprised of even smaller contractile proteins called myofilaments.\n The two myofilaments include actin, the thin filament, and myosin, the thick filament. Each myosin filament is surrounded by six actin filaments. These myofilaments overlap lengthwise to form a series of interconnected segments called sarcomeres.  The sarcomere is often referred to as the smallest functional unit of the skeletal muscle fiber. The ends of each sarcomere are designated by a dense Z-line. When examined under magnification, the overlapping of actin and myosin creates light and dark bands which, along with the Z-lines, give the skeletal muscle a striped or striated appearance. For this reason, skeletal muscle is also referred to as striated muscle.        Sliding Filament Theory The widely-accepted sliding filament theory has been suggested as an explanation regarding the process of skeletal muscle contraction.\n The sliding filament theory states that when sufficiently stimulated by the nervous system, the small heads extending from the myosin filaments bind with the actin filaments creating cross-bridges. The actin filaments are then pulled (called a power stroke), in a sliding fashion, across the myosin filament. This sliding action brings the Z-lines closer together, shortening the sarcomere without the myofilaments themselves changing length. As this sliding action occurs within the entire series of adjacent sarcomeres, the end result is a muscular contraction or shortening of the muscle.  Once the stimulus from the nervous system is removed, the cross-bridges between actin and myosin will release and the muscle will relax to its normal resting length.\n In order for this contraction to occur, the muscle must receive an impulse or action potential from the central nervous system, and an adequate supply of energy in the form of ATP must be available within the muscle.  Attachments Skeletal muscles attach to the bone via a tendon.\n The musculotendinous attachment that is located at the more stable end of the body segment, which tends to be located proximally, is called the origin. The musculotendinous attachment that is located at the moving end of the body segment, which tends to be located distally, is called the insertion.  Reviewing the shoulder complex, notice the biceps muscle:\n originates at the glenoid fossa and coracoid process of the scapula, and inserts on the proximal aspect of the radius    Actions Skeletal muscles produce the force necessary to move or stabilize the skeleton.\nThere are two main types of muscle actions during which force is produced: isometric and isotonic.\n Isometric action, the muscle produces force, but there is no movement and therefore no change in the muscle length.  This is also sometimes referred to as a static contraction.   Isotonic action, the muscle shortens and lengthens as force is generated to lift and lower an external load, respectively.  Isometric Isometric exercises are performed in static positions involving no movement.\n During isometric exercises, the muscles exert force against  an immovable object, such as pushing a wall; two equal yet opposing forces, such as placing the palms of the hands together and pushing; or a static position is held, such as the side-lying plank.    Isotonic Isotonic exercises involve two phases of movement.\n During the concentric phase, the muscle shortens as the external resistance is lifted. During the eccentric phase, the muscle lengthens as the external resistance is lowered.  For example, when performing a dumbbell biceps curl:\n Concentric phase occurs as the elbow is flexed and the dumbbell is lifted toward the shoulder Eccentric phase occurs as the dumbbell is lowered in a controlled manner back to the starting position In this example, the biceps provides the muscular force during each phase of the exercise, to both lift the dumbbell and to control the descent as the dumbbell is lowered with each repetition.  The most common types of resistance training, such as free weights and selectorized machines, involve isotonic muscle actions to lift and lower a specific amount of weight.\nHere’s a helpful hint when identifying the concentric and eccentric phase of a resistance training exercise.\nWhen performing a resistance training exercise using an unchanging external load, such as a dumbbell, barbell, or plates on a selectorized machine:\n Concentric phase always occurs as the weight is lifted away from the ground and Eccentric phase always occurs as the weight is lowered back toward the ground  For example, descending during a dumbbell squat is the eccentric phase; whereas, ascending during the squat is the concentric phase. Similarly, lowering the barbell during a bench press is the eccentric phase and lifting the barbell upward is the concentric phase.\nFunctions Muscles are called upon to play a variety of roles during resistance training:\n  Agonist (also known as the prime mover) is the muscle or group of muscles that are primarily responsible for a specific movement\n For example, the agonist or prime mover during elbow flexion, such as during a dumbbell curl, is the biceps.    Antagonist is the muscle or group of muscles that work in direct opposition to the agonist\n The triceps muscle is the antagonist to the biceps.    Synergists are one or more muscles that assist the agonist to perform a certain movement\n For example, the brachialis muscle acts as a synergist during elbow flexion to assist the biceps.    Stabilizers are various muscles that also act to prevent undesirable movement and to support a fixed joint position during a specific exercise\n For example, the muscles of the rotator cuff stabilize the glenohumeral joint, while muscles of the upper back stabilize the scapula providing a stable foundation for the shoulder complex and upper arm during an exercise such as the dumbbell curl.    It would be quite a tall task to learn the names and functions of over 600 muscles in the human body. With time, your knowledge of muscular anatomy will grow.\nAlthough it is not necessary to learn every muscle in the body, it is important to have a good working knowledge of the major muscles throughout the body, their functions, and appropriate exercises to target the various muscles.\nMajor Skeletal Muscles A more comprehensive review of muscular anatomy will be covered in the upcoming kinesiology section.\n- Deltoid (Anterior) - Deltoid (Posterior) - Pectoralis Major - Trapezius - Latissimus Dorsi - Erector Spinae - External Obliques - Rectus Abdominis - Biceps Brachii - Triceps Brachii - Iliopsoas - Hip Adductors - Quadriceps - Gluteus Medius - Gluteus Maximus - Hamstrings - Gastrocnemius - Soleus - Tibialis Anterior   Section 2: Kinesiology Derived from two Greek words, kinesis (meaning motion) and logos (meaning knowledge): kinesiology is the study of human movement.\nThis section on kinesiology reviews the joint actions and related muscle groups as well as common exercises related to basic human movement patterns.\nMovement Terminology Review the basic movement terminology…\nFrom the anatomic position:\n Flexion is decreasing a joint angle, bringing two body segments closer together Extension is increasing a joint angle, moving two body segments apart and returning back to the anatomic position Hyperextension is the continuation of extension moving beyond the anatomic position In the anatomic position, flexion, extension, and hyperextension typically occur in the sagittal plane of motion  From the anatomic position:\n Abduction is movement of a body part, such as the arm or leg, away from the midline of the body Adduction is movement of a body part toward the midline of the body In the anatomic position, abduction and adduction typically occur through the frontal plane of motion  From the anatomic position:\n Rotation is a movement around the vertical axis of a long bone or around the axial midline of the body. Rotation can occur to the right or left around the center of the body, or internally and externally around a bone such as the humerus of the upper arm or the femur of the upper leg.  Next we will take a closer look at movements and their corresponding muscles or muscle groups throughout the body beginning with the shoulder complex.\nMovements \u0026 Muscles of the Upper Body Shoulder Complex Abduction \u0026 Adduction Abduction is the movement of the arm away from the midline of the body\n Starting from the anatomic position, full range of motion for shoulder abduction is approximately 180 degrees The middle deltoid is the primary muscle responsible for shoulder abduction The supraspinatus also contributes to abduction through the initial 30 degrees of movement  Adduction is movement of the arm back toward the midline of the body starting from an abducted position\n Starting from the anatomic position, the arm is able to adduct approximately 50 degrees toward the midline and across the body The latissimus dorsi and the teres major are the primary muscles responsible for shoulder or arm adduction  Both shoulder abduction and adduction occur primarily in the frontal plane of motion.\nHorizontal Abduction \u0026 Adduction Horizontal abduction is movement of the arm parallel to the ground, away from the midline of the body, through the transverse plane of motion\n From a neutral starting position, the arm is able to horizontally abduct approximately 125 degrees The primary muscle responsible for this movement at the shoulder joint is the posterior deltoid  Horizontal adduction is movement of the arm (starting in the opposite direction), toward or across the midline of the body\n Again starting from a neutral position with the arm held directly forward and parallel to the ground, the arm is able to horizontally adduct approximately 50 degrees The pectoralis major is the primary muscle responsible for horizontal adduction of the arm  Both horizontal abduction and horizontal adduction occur in the transverse plane of motion.\nFlexion \u0026 Extension Shoulder flexion is the movement of raising the arm forward\n Primarily performed by the anterior deltoid Full range of motion for shoulder flexion is approximately 180 degrees  Shoulder extension is movement of the arm (starting from a position of shoulder flexion), back to the anatomic position and posterior to the body\n Similar to adduction of the arm, the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles are responsible for shoulder extension From the anatomic position, the shoulder is able to extend approximately 50 degrees posterior to the body Since this movement is a continuation of shoulder extension beyond the anatomic position, it may also be referred to as shoulder hyperextension  Shoulder flexion and extension occur in the sagittal plane of motion.\nInternal \u0026 External Rotation External rotation is rotation of the shoulder away from the body around the long axis of the humerus\n Two of the rotator cuff muscles, the infraspinatus and the teres minor, are responsible for shoulder external rotation External rotation is also referred to as outward or lateral rotation  Internal rotation is rotation of the shoulder toward the body around the long axis of the humerus\n Another of the rotator cuff muscles, the subscapularis, performs internal rotation of the shoulder Internal rotation is also referred to as inward or medial rotation  The shoulder is able to externally and internally rotate to approximately 80 degrees in either direction. In most cases, range of motion through external rotation is slightly greater compared to internal.\nExternal and internal rotation occur primarily in the transverse plane of motion.\nScapular Protraction \u0026 Retraction Scapular protraction refers to movement of the scapula away from the posterior midline of the body\n The muscles primarily involved in scapular protraction include the pectoralis minor and serratus anterior  Scapular retraction is movement of the scapula toward the posterior midline of the body\n The rhomboids and middle fibers of the trapezius are primarily responsible for scapular retraction  Scapular Elevation \u0026 Depression Scapular elevation is raising the scapula as seen during a shoulder shrug\n The upper trapezius and levator scapula muscles are responsible for this action  Scapular depression is lowering the scapula back to their neutral position, which results from the pull of gravity, but also activation of the lower trapezius muscles\n Deltoid Review the anterior view of the left upper arm and scapula, including the anterior and middle fibers of the deltoid muscle.\n Anterior deltoid performs shoulder flexion as seen during a front dumbbell raise Middle deltoid performs shoulder abduction as seen during a lateral dumbbell raise  Other resistance training exercises that target both the anterior and middle deltoid include a shoulder press and scaption, which involves lifting dumbbells with the thumbs pointed upward through a position approximately 30 degrees anterior to the frontal plane.\n Posterior deltoid is primarily responsible for horizontal abduction of the shoulder as seen during a reverse fly using dumbbells, cables, or resistance tubing. (The posterior fibers of the deltoid are located on the back of the shoulder.)     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Lateral third of the clavicle, the acromion process, and the spine of scapula Deltoid tuberosity of the humerus Anterior: Shoulder Flexion, Middle: Shoulder Abduction, Posterior: Shoulder Horizontal Abduction Shoulder Press (middle, anterior), Lateral Raise (middle), Scaption (middle, anterior), Reverse Fly (posterior)       Rotator Cuff - SITS Supraspinatus Review the anterior view of the left upper arm and scapula, with the deltoid muscle removed to expose the underlying muscles including the supraspinatus.\nSupraspinatus is one of the four rotator cuff muscles and is represented by the first “s” in the rotator cuff acronym “SITS”\n The supraspinatus originates at the supraspinous fossa of the scapula, located superior to the spine of the scapula, and inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus Notice that the supraspinatus muscle passes under the acromion process of the scapula through the subacromial space The supraspinatus assists the deltoid during the first 30 degrees of shoulder abduction In conjunction with the other rotator cuff muscles, the supraspinatus also stabilizes the glenohumeral joint     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Supraspinous fossa of the scapula Greater tubercle of the humerus Shoulder abduction (first 30 degrees), Glenohumeral stabilization Lateral Raise, Scaption      Infraspinatus \u0026 Teres Minor Review the posterior view of the left upper arm and scapula, including the posterior fibers of the deltoid as well as two of the four rotator cuff muscles, the infraspinatus and teres minor.\nInfraspinatus and Teres Minor are represented by the “I” and the “T”, respectively in the rotator cuff acronym “SITS”\n Together these two muscles perform external rotation of the shoulder and are often targeted performing this movement against resistance tubing, a cable column, or side-lying with a dumbbell The infraspinatus and teres minor also work as force couples with the other two rotator cuff muscles to stabilize the glenohumeral joint during movements of the shoulder and arm     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Infraspinatus fossa of the scapula, Axillary border of the scapula (teres minor) Greater tubercle of the humerus Shoulder external rotation, Glenohumeral stabilization External rotation with cable or tubing, External rotation side-lying with dumbbell      Subscapularis Review the anterior view of the left upper arm and scapula, with the rib cage removed exposing a clear sight-line to the subscapularis muscle located on anterior aspect of the scapula.\nSubscapularis is the last of the four rotator cuff muscles, represented by the second “S” in the “SITS” acronym\n The subscapularis internally rotates the shoulder, and works with the other rotator cuff muscles to stabilize the glenohumeral joint The subscapularis may be targeted performing shoulder internal rotation using resistance tubing, a cable column, or side-lying using a dumbbell     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Subscapular fossa of the scapula Lesser tubercle of the humerus Shoulder internal rotation, Glenohumeral stabilization Internal rotation with cable or tubing, Internal rotation side-lying with dumbbell       Teres Major Teres Major muscle originates on the scapula and inserts on the proximal end of the humerus\n The teres major performs both shoulder adduction and shoulder extension As such, the teres major works synergistically with the latissimus dorsi in many pulling movements such as a seated narrow row, a dumbbell one-arm row, and a lat pulldown     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Dorsal surface of the inferior angle of scapula Lesser tubercle of the humerus Shoulder adduction, Shoulder extension Seated Narrow Row, Dumbbell One-Arm Row, Lat Pulldown       Pectoralis Major Pectoralis Major is the large fan-shaped muscle of the chest\n The primary joint action performed by the pectoralis major is shoulder or arm horizontal adduction, but the pectoralis major also assists with shoulder flexion and internal rotation Common exercises targeting the pectoralis major include the barbell bench press, chest press performed on a machine or using dumbbells, push-ups, and variations of the chest fly using a machine, cable column, or dumbbells     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Sternum, clavicle, costal cartilage of upper 6 ribs Lateral lip of the intertubercular grove and crest of the greater tubercle of the humerus Shoulder horizontal adduction, Shoulder flexion, Shoulder internal rotation Bench Press, Chest Press (machine or dumbbells), Push-up, Cable Chest fly       Pectoralis Minor \u0026 Serratus Anterior Review the anterior view of the torso with the pectoralis major muscles removed to expose the underlying pectoralis minor.\nPectoralis Minor originates on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th ribs, and inserts on the coracoid process of the scapula\n The contracting pectoralis minor protracts the scapula Since many individuals sit for prolonged periods of time with poor posture including rounded shoulders and protracted scapula, the pectoralis minor muscles tend to be tight Therefore, it is rarely necessary to perform strength-oriented exercises attempting to isolate the pectoralis minor; however, many people would benefit from flexibility exercises intended to stretch and lengthen both the pectoralis minor and major     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     3rd through 5th ribs Coracoid process of scapula Scapular protraction, Scapular stabilization Push-up Plus (protraction at end ROM)      Serratus Anterior muscles also function to protract the scapula\n The serratus anterior is important for scapular stabilization against the thorax The serratus anterior originates from the 4th through 12th ribs and inserts along the length of the anterior surface of the medial border of the scapula     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     4th through 12th ribs Length of the anterior surface of the medial border of the scapula Scapular protraction, Scapular stabilization Push-up Plus (protraction at end ROM)       Trapezius Trapezius is the large kite-shaped muscle spanning from the base of the skull to the middle back\n  The trapezius has three fairly distinct sections characterized by the direction of the muscle fibers, which include:\n Upper Trapezius fibers elevate the scapula and function to perform upward rotation of the scapula when the arm is being abducted  Activate during a dumbbell or barbell shrug as the shoulders are elevated, as well as a shoulder press due to the need for upward rotation of the scapula   Middle Trapezius helps to retract the scapula  Active during rowing type exercises that involve retraction of the scapula like a wide or narrow row   Lower Trapezius depress the scapula and help to downwardly rotate the scapula during resisted arm adduction  Active during a front lat pulldown or pull-up as the scapula downwardly rotate in conjunction with adduction of the arms.

(middle), Front Lat Pulldown (lower)       Rhomboids Review the posterior view of the torso with the trapezius muscles removed to expose the rhomboids.\nRhomboids originate from the spinous processes of the seventh cervical vertebra through the fifth thoracic vertebra, and insert along the medial borders of the scapula\n The rhomboids primarily function to retract the scapula; however, the directional line of the fibers also allow the rhomboids to downwardly rotate the scapula The rhomboids are active during many pulling exercises such as the seated rows in both the narrow and wide position, lat pulldown, and pull-ups     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Spinous processes of C7-T5 Medial border of scapula Scapular retraction, Scapular downward rotation Seated Narrow Row, Seated Wide Row, Front Lat Pulldown, Pull-up, Assisted Pull-up       Latissimus Doris Latissimus Dorsi, often referred to as simply the Lats, are the large wing-shaped muscles through the mid to lower back\n The lats function to both extend the shoulder in the sagittal plane and adduct the shoulder in the frontal plane The latissimus dorsi works synergistically with the subscapularis and pectoralis major to internally rotate the humerus The lats are used during a wide variety of pulling exercises such as the lat pulldown, pull-up, one-arm row, and seated narrow row     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Spinous processes of T7-T12 and sacrum via the thoracolumbar fascia Medial intertubercular groove of the humerus Shoulder (arm) extension, Shoulder (arm) adduction, Shoulder internal rotation Seated Narrow Row, Front Lat Pulldown, Pull-up \u0026 Assisted Pull-up, One-Arm Row (cable or dumbbell)       Elbow The elbow is a hinge joint allowing for movement through one plane of motion, the sagittal plane\n Elbow flexion involves decreasing the joint angle by moving the distal end of the forearm closer to the proximal end of the humerus The elbow is able to flex approximately 145 degrees The primary muscle responsible for elbow flexion is the biceps From a flexed position, increasing the joint angle of the elbow back to the anatomic position is called elbow extension The triceps muscle on the posterior side of the upper arm is responsible for elbow extension Although some individuals are able to hyperextend the elbow, in most cases the elbow is not able to extend past the anatomic position  Biceps Brachii Biceps derives its name from the two-headed structure, with the long head originating from the glenoid fossa of the scapula and the short head from the coracoid process of the scapula\n The biceps insert on the proximal aspect of the radius The primary function of the biceps is to flex the elbow as seen during a dumbbell or barbell biceps curl as well as all multi-joint upper body pulling exercises     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Long Head: glenoid fossa of scapula, Short Head: coracoid process of scapula Radial tuberosity of radius Elbow flexion Dumbbell Biceps Curl, Barbell Biceps Curl, Preacher Curl      Triceps Brachii Review the posterior view of the left upper arm and scapula.\nTriceps has three heads including the long, medial, and lateral heads, all of which converge to insert on the olecranon process of the ulna located on the back of the elbow\n The triceps extends the elbow joint during a cable triceps pushdown and during all multi-joint upper body pushing exercises     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Medial \u0026 Lateral Heads: proximal and posterior aspect of humerus, Long Head: infraglenoid tubercle of scapula Olecranon process of the ulna Elbow extension Cable Triceps Pushdown, Supine Dumbbell Elbow Extension       Movements \u0026 Muscles of the Spine and Torso Spine Spinal flexion involves bending the torso forward, which is primarily performed by the rectus abdominis\n Normal range of motion for spinal flexion is approximately 120 degrees, which is distributed along the many segments of the spinal column  Spinal extension (starting from a position of spinal flexion) is movement of the torso back to the anatomic position and posterior to the body\n This is movement arises from contraction of the erector spinae muscle group From the anatomic position, the torso is able to extend approximately 30 degrees posterior to the body Since this movement is a continuation of spinal extension beyond the anatomic position, it may also be referred to as spinal hyperextension  Flexion and extension of the spine and torso occur in the sagittal plane of motion\nSpinal rotation is the side-to-side twisting or turning movement of the torso through the center axis of the body\n Although many muscles may be involved in spinal rotation, the internal and external obliques are often identified as the primary muscles The spine is able to rotate approximately 40 degrees to either side with the range of motion arising from multiple segments of the spinal column Spinal rotation occurs in the transverse plane of motion  Lateral flexion of the spine is the side-to-side bending of the torso\n The quadratus lumborum muscle plays a significant role in lateral flexion of the spine, as does ipsilateral contraction of the rectus abdominis and erector spinae muscles The spine is able to laterally flex approximately 35 degrees to each side from the anatomic neutral position Lateral flexion occurs in the frontal plane of motion  Erector Spinae Erector spinae is a large muscle group on the posterior of the torso that spans from the sacrum to the cervical spine\n This includes the iliocostalis, longissimus, and spinalis individually named by their location through the lumbar, thoracic and cervical regions of the spine, respectively This muscle group functions to  concentrically extend the spine, eccentrically to decelerate spinal flexion, and isometrically to stabilize the spine   The erector spinae muscles are involved in exercises such as the back extension machine, back extension on a Roman Chair, and during the bird-dog exercise     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Sacrum and iliac crest of pelvis, Spinous and transverse processes of T11-L5 Inferior border of ribs 7-12, Spinous and transverse processes of T4-T12 Spinal extension, Spinal stabilization Back Extension Machine, Roman Chair Back Extension, Back Extension Prone on Stability Ball, Bird-Dog       Core Muscles The core muscles of the anterolateral torso include the\n transverse abdominis internal and external obliques rectus abdominis  Transverse Abdominis Transverse abdominis is the deepest of these muscles, which originates on the inguinal ligament, iliac crest, thoracolumbar fascia, and the lower six ribs\n The transverse abdominis inserts on the xiphoid process, linea alba, inguinal ligament, and pubis When activated, the transverse abdominis compresses the abdominal contents and increases intra-abdominal pressure as experienced when performing a drawing-in maneuver or bracing the abdominals     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Inguinal ligament, iliac crest, spinal thoracolumbar fascia, and cartilages of the lower 6 ribs Xiphoid process, linea alba, inguinal ligament and pubis Spinal stabilization, Abdominal compression “Drawing-in” Maneuver, Abdominal “Bracing”      Internal Obliques Internal obliques is the next superficial layer of the core muscles\n The internal obliques originate on the inguinal ligament, the iliac crest, and the thoracolumbar fascia, and insert on the lower three ribs, the linea alba, and the xiphoid process Concentrically, the internal obliques function to flex and laterally flex the spine as well as create ipsilateral rotation of the spine Isometrically, the internal obliques assist to stabilize the lumbo-pelvic-hip region     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Inguinal ligament, iliac crest and part of the

Chops (Downward Rotation)      External Obliques External obliques is the next layer of the core muscles, which originate from the lower eight ribs and insert on the linea alba, pubis, and iliac crest\n Concentrically, the external obliques function to flex, laterally flex, and contralaterally rotate the spine Both the internal and external obliques are active during planks, various types of crunches, and exercises that involve rotation of the torso     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Lower 8 ribs Linea alba, pubis and iliac crest Spinal stabilization, Spinal rotation, Spinal flexion/lateral flexion Prone Planks, Oblique Crunches, Stability Ball Crunches, Hay Bailers (Upward Rotation)      Rectus Abdominis Rectus abdominis is the outermost superficial layer\n The rectus abdominis originates from the pubic symphysis of the pelvis and the fibers run vertically to insert on the xiphoid process of the sternum and the 5th through 7th ribs The rectus abdominis is ideally positioned as the primary mover for spinal flexion, but may also assist with lateral flexion of the spine An isometric contraction of the rectus abdominis stabilizes the lumbar spine to prevent spinal extension as seen during a prone plank Exercises that involves spinal flexion, such as an abdominal crunch, recruit rectus abdominis muscles     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Pubic symphysis of the pelvis Xiphoid process and the cartilage of the 5th through 7th ribs Spinal stabilization, Spinal flexion Prone Planks, Abdominal Crunches, Stability Ball Crunches       Movements \u0026 Muscles of the Lower Body Hips Hip flexion lifts the leg forward, which is primarily performed by the iliopsoas muscles with assistance from the rectus femoris\n Full range of motion for hip flexion is approximately 110 degrees  Hip extension (starting from a position of hip flexion), is movement of the leg back to the anatomic position and posterior to the body\n The gluteus maximus is primarily responsible for hip extension, with significant assistance from the hamstring muscle group From the anatomic position, the hip is able to extend approximately 30 degrees posterior to the body Since this movement is a continuation of hip extension beyond the anatomic position, it may also be referred to as hip hyperextension, although most commonly it is still referred to as hip extension  Hip flexion and extension occur in the sagittal plane of motion\nHip abduction is movement of the leg laterally away from the midline of the body\n Starting from the anatomic position, full range of motion for hip abduction is approximately 45 degrees The gluteus medius and gluteus minimus are the primary muscles responsible for hip abduction  Hip adduction (starting from an abducted position) is movement of the leg medially back toward the midline of the body\n Starting from the anatomic position, the leg can be adducted approximately 25 degrees toward the midline and across the body The adductor muscle group includes:  adductor magnus adductor longus adductor brevis pectineus gracillis    Both hip abduction and adduction occur primarily in the frontal plane of motion\nGlutes Gluteus Maximus Review the posterior-lateral view of the hip.\nGluteus Maximus is among the largest muscles in the human body\n The primary function of the gluteus maximus is to extend the hip as seen during the concentric phase of a squat, leg press, lunge, or deadlift     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Posterior pelvis along lower part of ilium, sacrum, and coccyx Gluteal tuberosity of femur and iliotibial band Hip Extension Barbell Squat, Stability Ball/Wall Squat, Leg Press, Lunge, Straight-Leg Deadlift       Gluteus Medius Review the posterior-lateral view of the hip, but with the gluteus maximus removed to expose the underlying muscles of the hip, including the gluteus medius.\nGluteus medius originates on the outer surface of the ilium and inserts on the greater trochanter of the femur\n The gluteus medius abducts the hip and leg, but also isometrically prevents hip adduction of the supported leg during a single leg stance Performing hip abduction in a standing position using either resistance tubing or a cable column recruits the gluteus medius muscle of the unsupported leg during both the concentric and eccentric phase of the exercise, and also recruits the gluteus medius of the supported leg to stabilize the pelvis and isometrically prevent hip adduction     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Outer surface of the ilium Greater trochanter of the femur Hip abduction, Stabilization of pelvis and leg during single leg stance Standing Hip Abduction with Cable Column, Lateral Stepping with Resistance Tubing, Seated Hip Abduction Machine       Iliopsoas (Ilicus, Psoas Major \u0026 Minor) Review the anterior view of the torso and hips, with some of the superficial muscles removed on the left side of the body for better viewing of the underlying muscles.\nIliopsoas (also known as the hip flexors), is the muscle group comprised of the ilicus, psoas major, and psoas minor\n The primary function of the iliopsoas muscles is hip flexion Many individuals may have overly tight hip flexor muscles as the result of chronic sitting and sedentary lifestyles Considering the points of origin, tight iliopsoas muscles may contribute to increased lumbar lordosis and altered lumbo-pelvic hip position leading to low back pain As such, many would benefit more from flexibility exercises for the hip flexors rather than strength-oriented exercises     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Psoas: Transverse processes of T12-L5, Ilicus: Inner border of illium Lesser trochanter of the femur Hip flexion Supine Straight Leg Raise, Hip Flexion on Multi-Hip Machine       Adductor Muscle Group Adductor muscle group is comprised of the adductor magnus, adductor longus, adductor brevis, pectineus, and gracillis\n These muscles originate at various points on the pelvis and insert along the medial aspect of the femur and the proximal medial aspect of the tibia Similar to the iliopsoas, many individuals may have overly tight hip adductors, often coupled with weak hip abductors including the gluteus medius Although a seated hip adduction machine will certainly target the large hip adductor muscle group, many individuals would likely benefit to a greater extent from stretches to target this muscle group     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Magnus: Ischial tuberosity and ramus of pelvis, Brevis: Inferior ramus of the pubis, Longus: Crest of the symphysis pubis, Gracillis: Symphysis pubis and the public arch Magnus: Linea aspera and adductor tubercle on femur, Brevis: Linea aspera of the femur, Longus: Linea aspera of the femur, Gracillis: Medial surface of the tibia inferior to the condyle Hip adduction Hip Adduction Machine       Knee The knee, like the elbow, is a hinge joint, allowing flexion and extension through the sagittal plane of motion\nKnee flexion involves decreasing the joint angle by moving the heel toward the gluteus\n Normal range of motion for knee flexion is approximately 140 degrees Knee flexion results from a contraction of the hamstring muscle group  Knee extension (starting from knee flexion) is increasing the joint angle at the knee and returning to the anatomic position\n From the anatomically neutral position, the knee may be able to hyperextend up to less than five degrees, although hyperextension of the knee is not recommended Knee extension results from a contraction of the quadriceps muscle group to extend the knee  Quadriceps Muscle Group Quadriceps are the muscles located on the anterior side of the upper leg and includes the rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis\n The quadriceps muscles cross over the knee joint and collectively insert on the tibial tuberosity by way of the patellar tendon The primary function of the quadriceps is to extend the knee; however, the rectus femoris is also able to assist with hip flexion The quadriceps muscle is involved in all lower body exercises that require extension of the knee such as squats, lunges, the leg press, and the leg extension machine     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Rectus Femoris: Anterior inferior iliac spine, Vasti: Greater trochanter, proximal femur, ischial tuberosity Tibial tuberosity of tibia via patellar tendon Knee extension, Hip flexion (rectus femoris only) Barbell Squat, Stability Ball/Wall Squat, Leg Press, Lunge, Leg Extension Machine       Hamstring Muscle Group Hamstring muscles are located on the posterior aspect of the upper leg and include biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus\n The hamstring muscles all originate from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis and cross the knee to insert on both medial and lateral aspects of the proximal lower leg Since the hamstrings cross both the hip and knee joints, this muscle group is involved in both knee flexion and hip extension Although the hamstrings are often recruited through exercises that flex the knee, such as a seated, prone, standing, or stability ball leg curl, the hamstrings are also active during exercises that involve extension of the hip such as a squat or a deadlift     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Ischial tuberosity of pelvis Biceps Femoris: Head of fibula, Semi: Medial tibial condyle of tibia Knee flexion, Hip extension Barbell Squat, Seated or Prone Leg Curl Machine, Standing Leg Curl, Stability Ball Leg Curl, Straight-Leg Deadlift       Ankles Ankle joint is comprised of the articulation between three bones, the distal ends of both the tibia and the fibula, and the superior aspect of the talus\nTalocrural Joint Talocrural joint is also called the ankle joint and functions like a hinge allowing movements called dorsiflexion and plantar flexion\nDorsiflexion is moving the top of the foot closer to the knee, or lifting the foot up\n The tibialis anterior is the primary muscle dorsiflexing the ankle ROM: 0-20  Plantar flexion is moving the bottom of the foot away from the knee, or pointing the foot down\n The gastrocnemius and soleus muscles plantar flex the ankle ROM: 0-40  Both dorsiflexion and plantar flexion occur primarily in the sagittal plane of motion\nSubtalar Joint Subtalar joint is another important joint of the ankle that is formed by the articulation between the talus and the calcaneus\n The subtalar joint allows for inversion and eversion of the foot The tibialis anterior and the tibialis posterior contribute to ankle inversion (ROM: 0-20) Two key muscles that contribute to ankle eversion include the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles of the lower leg (ROM: 0-15) The subtalar joint is generally more mobile into ankle inversion, and subsequently most ankle sprains are inversion sprains However, eversion of the foot may also be related or contribute to a valgus (inward) position of the knee  Both inversion and eversion occur primarily in the frontal plane of motion\nThe ankle is also able to supinate and pronate:\n Supination is actually a combination of inversion, plantarflexion, and adduction of the ankle Pronation is a combination of eversion, dorsiflexion, and abduction  Gastrocnemius \u0026 Soleus The two major muscles of the posterior lower leg are the gastrocnemius and soleus\nGastrocnemius originates superior to the knee on the lateral and medial condyles of the femur\nSoleus is located deep to the gastrocnemius and originates inferior to the knee on the head of the fibula and the inner border of the tibia\n Both the gastrocnemius and soleus insert on the calcaneus (heel) by way of the Achilles tendon Both the gastrocnemius and soleus plantar flex the ankle Since the gastrocnemius also crosses the posterior knee, this muscle can assist the hamstrings to flex the knee The gastrocnemius and soleus muscles are the primary muscles involved in standing heel raises, also called calf raises     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Gastrocnemius: Lateral and medial (posterior) condyles of the femur, Soleus: Head of the fibula and inner border of the tibia Calcaneus via the Achilles tendon Ankle plantar flexion (both), Knee flexion (gastrocnemius) Standing Heel Raise (both), Seated Heel Raise (soleus)       Tibialis Anterior Tibialis anterior is located on the anterior aspect of the lower leg along the tibia\n The tibialis anterior is primarily responsible for ankle dorsiflexion Although not often included in a typical resistance training routine, the tibialis anterior may be targeted with standing toe raises or resisted dorsiflexion exercises One may also experience delayed onset muscle soreness through the tibialis anterior following unaccustomed downhill walking or running due to the eccentric work of the tibialis anterior to decelerate plantar flexion of the ankle     Origin Insertion Action Recommended Exercises     Later condyle and upper two thirds of the tibia shaft First cuneiform (small bones in the feet) and base of the first metatarsal Ankle dorsiflexion, Ankle inversion Standing Toe Raises, Dorsiflexion with resistance tubing       Section 3: Biomechanics Biomechanics is the study of the principles of mechanics, motion, and movement related to the biological systems of the body.\nThis section takes a focused look at how the human body moves with respect to the laws of physics, the physiology of human movement, and implications for safe and effective exercise.\nLaws of Motion There are several natural laws that govern the external forces applied to the body and the corresponding movements that are generated by the musculoskeletal system. The most important laws as related to the study of biomechanics originate from the discoveries of a 17th century scientist named Sir Isaac Newton.\nLaw of Inertia Law of Inertia (Newton’s first law of motion) states that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion (in the same direction and velocity) unless an external force acts upon the object.\n In other words, an object that is not in motion (i.e., velocity = zero) will remain stationary until a force causes it to move. The magnitude of this inertia is proportional to the mass of the object such that a heavier object (i.e., greater mass) will possess more inertia or reluctance to move. Likewise, an object in motion will continue moving at its current speed and in its current direction until a force such as gravity, causes its velocity (e.g., speed and/or direction of movement) to change.  Inertia is the reluctance of an object to change its current state of motion.\n When the forces acting upon an object are equal, the object is said to be in a state of equilibrium. An object that is not moving is in a state of static equilibrium. If an object is in motion without any change in velocity (i.e., no acceleration, deceleration, or change in direction), then the object is in a state of dynamic equilibrium.  Since many synovial joints throughout the body rotate around an axis of rotation, many movements of the body are rotational in nature.\n Closely related to the law of inertia is the concept of rotational inertia, which refers to the reluctance of a body segment or object to rotate around an axis of rotation (e.g., joint). Similar to torque, rotational inertia is proportional to the mass of the object and the distance of the object’s center of mass from the axis of rotation or joint. A heavier object located a greater distance from the axis of rotation possesses more rotational inertia (i.e., “reluctance to rotate”).  For example, a baseball bat has less rotational inertia when held by the barrel of the bat (thick end) rather than by the handle since the bat’s center of mass is moved closer to the axis of rotation in this position. Likewise, when a little league coach instructs a player to ‘choke up on the bat', the strategy is to shift the bat’s center of gravity closer to the body creating less rotational inertial and allowing the player to more easily swing the bat.    Law of Acceleration Law of Acceleration (Newton’s second law of motion) states that a force applied to an object causes an acceleration of the object in the direction of the force that is proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.\n The greater the external force acting upon an object, the more acceleration the force will generate. Similarly, a lighter object subjected to the same magnitude of force will experience greater acceleration.  Once an object has been set in motion by an external force it is said to have momentum.\n Momentum is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its velocity [M = m x v]. Momentum can be simply stated as ‘mass in motion’. A heavier object will possess more momentum than a lighter object when both are traveling at the same velocity. If two moving objects are of equal mass, the one traveling at the greater velocity will possess more momentum.  Since many joints in the human body move around an axis, this rotational motion creates angular momentum.\n  Angular momentum is generated by the mass of the object, the distance of the object from the axis of rotation, and the speed (velocity) at which the object is moving.\n  In other words, angular momentum is the product of the object’s mass, the distance of the object from the axis of rotation, and the velocity of the object.\n For example, when performing a kettlebell swing, more angular momentum is generated by:  Using a heavier kettlebell, Having longer arms, and/or Swinging the kettlebell faster      Subsequently, when a weight has more angular momentum it will require less concentric muscular force to keep the weight in motion whereas, a weight moved more slowly, therefore having less angular momentum, requires additional muscular force to keep it in motion.\n  Conversely, a weight possessing more angular momentum will actually require greater eccentric muscular forces of the antagonist muscles to decelerate the movement of the object as the end-range of motion is approached.\n  Law of Action-Reaction Law of Action-Reaction (Newton’s third law of motion) states that when an object applies a force to another object, there is an equal and opposite force back to the original object.\n In other words, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  While swimming, the individual pushes/pulls the water backward resulting in an opposite reaction force which propels the body forward through the water. In another example, when walking, running, or jumping, the foot exerts force against the ground.  The ground exerts an equal and opposite force back against the foot which is subsequently dispersed throughout the body’s kinetic chain (ankle, knee, hip, spine). This is referred to as ground reaction force.      The Lever Systems The bones and joints throughout the skeletal system act as levers to allow movement of body segments in response to muscular force.\nThe next section will review the components of a lever system and the three types of levers, highlighting examples found in the human body.\nTerminology Lever systems are comprised of three components: the fulcrum, the force, and the moment arm.\n Fulcrum is the pivot point of the lever system, also known as the axis of rotation Force is the action upon an object or lever causing acceleration or deceleration of movement Moment arm is represented by the perpendicular distance from the fulcrum at which the force is applied  During resistance training exercises, there are two opposing forces, one internal and one external, working within the lever system.\n Internal force is generated by the skeletal muscle, and is therefore called the muscle force. (For example, the biceps muscle represents the muscle force.) External force is applied against the body and is called the resistance force. (For example, the dumbbell represents the resistance force.)     The internal and external forces act through a corresponding moment arm. The moment arm, through which the muscle force acts, is called the force arm. (For example, the force arm in this illustration is the perpendicular distance from the fulcrum to the insertion point of the biceps on the radius of the forearm.)     The moment arm, through which the resistance force acts, is called the resistance arm. (For example, the resistance arm in this illustration is the perpendicular distance from the fulcrum to the center of mass of the dumbbell held in the hand.) Notice that the resistance arm is significantly longer than the force arm.    Classes A lever system falls into one of three classes.\nFirst Class In a first class lever system, the muscle force and the resistance force act on opposite sides of the fulcrum, but are applied in the same direction. As such, a first class lever resembles a see-saw.\nOf the two forces, the one positioned further from the fulcrum will have the mechanical advantage.\n For example, if the resistance force is closer to the fulcrum, then the muscle force will hold a mechanical advantage due to it’s longer moment (force arm). In other words, utilizing the advantage gained through a longer moment arm, the muscle force necessary to overcome the resistance force is lessened. The mechanical advantage ‘tips the scale’ in favor of the muscle force. On the other hand, if the muscle force is positioned closer to the fulcrum, then the muscle will be placed at a mechanical disadvantage to the resistance force.    An example of a first class lever can be seen as the skull flexes and extends in the sagittal plane through the cervical vertebrae.\n The first cervical vertebrae, called the atlas, serves as a fulcrum, the weight of the skull pulled forward by gravity is the resistance force, and the upper trapezius and cervical extensor muscles attaching to the base of the skull provide the muscle force. When the head moves forward, as seen when someone sits with poor posture, the length of the resistance arm increases, placing the muscle force at a mechanical disadvantage, thereby increasing the force required of the cervical extensor muscles.    Second Class In a second class lever system, the opposing muscle force and resistance force act on the same side of the fulcrum with the muscle force working through a longer moment arm than does the resistance force. As such, the muscle force has the mechanical advantage since it has a longer moment arm through which to work.\n  A wheel barrow is an example of a second class lever system.\n The significant mechanical advantage allows the muscle force to overcome much greater resistance force loads.    An example of a second class lever can be seen during plantar flexion of the ankle, such as during the calf raise exercise.\n The ball of the foot (distal end of first metatarsal) is the fulcrum, the body weight is the resistance force and the gastrocnemius and soleus deliver the muscle force via the Achilles tendon attaching to the calcaneus to perform plantar flexion, elevating the heel off the ground.    Third Class In a third class lever system, the opposing muscle force and resistance force act on the same side of the fulcrum with the muscle force working through a shorter moment arm than does the resistance force.\nIn this lever system, the resistance force has the mechanical advantage since it has a longer moment arm through which to work.\n  An example of a third class lever can be seen during flexion of the elbow during a biceps curl.\n The elbow (radiohumeral joint) is the fulcrum, the dumbbell is the resistance force, and the biceps brachii delivers the muscle force via the tendinous attachment to the proximal end of the radius. Since the dumbbell is much further from the elbow than the attachment of the biceps, the dumbbell works through a longer moment arm (i.e., resistance arm) and therefore the dumbbell holds the mechanical advantage.  Many joints such as the elbow, knee, shoulder, and hip function as third class lever systems.\nReview So, to review the characteristics of each of the three lever systems:\n First class lever system, the muscle force and the resistance force act on opposite sides of the fulcrum, with both forces applied in the same direction. Second class lever system, the opposing muscle force and resistance force act on the same side of the fulcrum with the muscle force working through a longer moment arm than does the resistance force. Third class lever system, the opposing muscle force and resistance force act on the same side of the fulcrum with the muscle force working through a shorter moment arm than does the resistance force.  Biomechanics of Torque When a force is applied to a distant point on a lever, a rotational movement around an axis of rotation occurs.\n This rotational force is called torque. Torque is the degree to which a force rotates an object around an axis of rotation.  Defined quantitatively, torque is the magnitude of the force multiplied by the length of the moment arm.\n Torque = Force x Moment Arm  During resistance training exercise, it is important consider both the external torque applied to the body and the internal torque generated by the musculoskeletal system.\nInternal Torque The torque generated internally by the musculoskeletal system is the product of the Muscle Force and the Force Arm.\n Internal Torque = Muscle Force (Mf) x Force Arm (Fa)  External Torque The torque applied externally, in this case by the pull of gravity on the dumbbell, is the product of the Resistance Force and the Resistance Arm.\n External Torque = Resistance Force (Rf) x Resistance Arm (Ra)  Since the gravitational pull on the dumbbell is always downward, the length of the resistance arm, defined as the perpendicular distance of the resistance force from the axis of rotation, changes throughout the range of motion.\n The external torque is greatest when the elbow passes through ~ 90 degrees of flexion. Although the mass of the dumbbell does not change, it will feel heaviest in this position. As the dumbbell moves toward either end of the range of motion, the dumbbell feels slightly lighter since the resistance arm shortens resulting in less external torque.    Practical Applications of Torque During the triceps kickback exercise, as the dumbbell moves away from the perpendicular line through the axis of rotation, in this case the elbow, the length of the resistance arm will increase, subsequently increasing the external torque applied to the triceps muscle.\n As the elbow approaches full extension, the dumbbell feels heavier due to the greater external torque resulting from the increased resistance arm. During this exercise, when the elbow is positioned at 90 degrees, the external torque on the triceps is minimal to nonexistent, therefore, the dumbbell applies very little load on the triceps, if any at all.  Of course, the difficulty of a resistance training exercise may be altered by selecting a heavier or lighter resistance.\nIn some cases, the difficulty of an exercise as determined by the external torque applied to the body, may also be manipulated by changing the length of the resistance arm.\n For example, during a standing hip abduction exercise, using either resistance tubing or a cable column, the external torque may be decreased by moving the ankle strap or tubing closer to the hip, thereby decreasing the length of the resistance arm and making the exercise feel easier even though the resistance force remains the same. A modification of this nature may be necessary when large increments of weight make it difficult to progress to the next level of resistance.  Applied Biomechanics The remaining section will review some of the key concepts of applied biomechanics including balance, stability, coordination, and the kinetic chain.\nBalance Balance is the ability to control the position of the body against external forces.\n Sensory receptors throughout the body provide valuable information to the brain via the afferent nerves. The central nervous system then delivers appropriate messages to the muscles via the efferent nerves allowing for adjustments in muscle recruitment and body position needed to maintain balance. Many sports and athletic activities require a high degree of balance. Activities of daily living may also require balance. Older adults have a greater risk of falling due to a diminished ability to balance. As such, safe and appropriate exercises designed to increase balance should be including within an exercise program, particularly for older adult clients.  Stability Stability is closely related to balance.\n  Stability is the ease with which balance can be maintained. Stability is influenced by the base of support and the center of gravity.\n Center of gravity is the theoretical point at which the body’s mass is concentrated and balanced between all three planes of motion. Base of support is established by the body’s contact point(s) with the ground or other stable surface.    Stability decreases as the center of gravity moves toward the outer limits of the base of support.\n  Stability decreases as the base of support is reduced (e.g., feet closer together or single leg stance).\n  Stability increases as the center of gravity is lowered closer to the ground.\n  A heavier body is more stable than a lighter body when all other factors remain the same.\n  Coordination Coordination is the ability to integrate several movements of the body simultaneously and sequentially to perform a complex task.\nMany fundamental movements and skills are learned early in life such as walking, jumping, and throwing. Other movements require much more coordination and practice such as swinging a golf club to drive a ball down the fairway. The field of motor learning is dedicated to the study of this sub-discipline of exercise science. The basic movement patterns to be included in a resistance training program include, squatting, pushing, pulling, and rotating.\nWhen introduced to a new skill, movement, or resistance training exercise, many individuals will benefit from having the activity broken down into small components to facilitate learning.\n As these new skills are learned, the movements will become more fluid and synchronized requiring less thought and in many cases less effort. With practice the movements become more efficient and seemingly effortless. In resistance training, this effect is often called neuromuscular education, whereby the nervous system and muscular system ‘learn' how to coordinate the activation of appropriate muscles to produce smooth, synchronized movement. Most of the strength gains observed during the early stages of a resistance training program are attributed to neuromuscular adaptations rather than muscle hypertrophy.  The Kinetic Chain A final concept to review with regard to biomechanics is the kinetic chain.\nKinetic chain is the series of interconnected segments and joints throughout the body.\n Proper movement throughout the kinetic chain requires the integrated function of the skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems. If any of the systems or components are disrupted, the remainder of the kinetic chain will be affected - ultimately impairing function and optimal movement.  Open \u0026 Closed Kinetic Chain Resistance training exercises may be categorized into either open or closed kinetic chain exercises.\n Open kinetic chain exercises are those during which the distal end (hand or foot) of the moving body segment is ‘open' in free space.  Open chain exercises tend to be single-joint movements, such as the leg extension machine.   Closed kinetic chain exercises are those during which the distal end (hand or foot) of the moving body segment is in a fixed position and remains in constant contact with the surface, usually the ground.  Closed chain exercises tend to be multiple-joint movements such as the squat, which requires movement through the hips, knees, and ankles.     Section 4: Exercise Physiology Physiology is the study of the physical and chemical processes, responses, and adaptations that occur throughout the body’s cells, tissues, and organs during and as the result of exercise.\n The bioenergetics, cardiovascular, respiratory, and neuromuscular systems each play an important role to support the demands of exercise. Fitness professionals should understand the role each system plays and the significance of the changes that the body undergoes to accommodate the demands of exercise and conditioning programs. At the end of this module you will be able to describe the physiological systems of the body and understand both the acute responses and long-term adaptations that occur within these systems during and as a result of exercise.  Cardiorespiratory System Cardiorespiratory system is comprised of both the circulatory and respiratory systems.\n Circulatory system includes the heart, the blood vessels, and the blood. Respiratory system includes the mouth, nose, trachea, lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and diaphragm.  Circulatory System The primary function of the cardiorespiratory system is to transport oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and cells of the body (e.g., muscle tissue) and to remove carbon dioxide and other waste products.\nAnatomy of the Heart The heart is a four-chambered organ comprised of cardiac muscle tissue.\n The four chambers of the heart include two atria and two ventricles. The incoming blood is received by the atria. The outgoing blood is pumped by the ventricles.     The right side of the heart is responsible for pulmonary circulation  receiving deoxygenated (oxygen-depleted) blood from the body, which is then pumped to the lungs for re-oxygenation   The left side of the heart is responsible for systemic circulation  receiving oxygenated (oxygen-rich) blood from the lungs, which is then pumped to the rest of the body       The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the superior and inferior vena cava.    The right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries.    The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins.    The left ventricle pumps blood to the rest of the body via the aorta and arteries.    The Pathway of Blood Flow To review the pathways of blood flow through the heart:\n Deoxygenated blood returns to the right atrium of the heart from all areas of the body and muscles via the veins, converging into the superior and inferior vena cava. The deoxygenated blood moves from the right atrium to the right ventricle, by way of the right atrioventricular or tricuspid valve, and is then pumped to the lungs, via the pulmonary arteries, to be re-oxygenated. The oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins and enters the left atrium. The oxygen rich blood moves from the left atrium to the left ventricle, by way of the left atrioventricular or bicuspid valve, and is then pumped to the body and muscles via the aorta and arteries.  Once the tissue and muscles extract the needed oxygen, the deoxygenated blood returns to the heart via the veins and the process begins again.\nBlood Vessels Arteries Oxygenated blood pumped from the left ventricle into the aorta travels through thick-walled arteries and the smaller arterioles.\n The network of arteries and arterioles carry blood away from the heart to the target tissues and cells, such as the vital organs, skeletal muscles, and other tissues throughout the body. Arterioles play a significant role during exercise to regulate blood flow to the appropriate tissues through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. During exercise, blood is re-directed to the working skeletal muscles to supply the needed oxygen and to the skin to dissipate heat.  Capillaries From the arterioles, the blood flows into a microscopic network of smaller vessels called capillaries.\n The capillaries are so tiny that some of the blood cells are forced to flow through the vessel single file. The thinness of the capillary walls and the slow speed of the blood flow through these tiny vessels make them excellent for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the surrounding tissues.  Blood Flow to and from the Heart Blood is collected from the capillaries by a network of venules, which deliver blood to the larger veins.\n The venules and veins return the de-oxygenated blood back to the heart. The walls of many veins contain one-way valves that help to maintain venous blood return to the heart by preventing back flow under the relatively low pressures.  Heart Rate Heart rate (HR) is the number of beats (cardiac cycles) of the heart per minute.\n Normal resting heart rate for an adult ranges between 60-90 b/min. During exercise, heart rate increases in proportion to the exercise intensity. Maximal heart rate is determined by genetics, age, and may be affected by medication, the environment, and other factors. Adaptations to regular cardiorespiratory exercise are seen through a lower resting heart rate and a reduced heart rate response to a specific submaximal exercise intensity.  Stroke Volume Stroke volume (SV) refers to the volume of blood that is pumped by the left ventricle with each heartbeat.\n Resting stroke volume for an adult typically ranges between 60-100 mL/beat. During exercise, stroke volume increases curvilinearly in response to exercise intensity, reaching maximum values of ~100-120 mL/beat. During exercise, the increased stroke volume begins to plateau at approximately 50% of maximum aerobic capacity for most individuals; however, in highly trained athletes, stroke volume may continue to increase during higher exercise intensity. Stroke volume increases across submaximal and maximal intensities as the result of regular exercise training. This increase in stroke volume may be attributed to increased end diastolic volume, increased blood plasma, greater diastolic filling time, and increased left ventricular wall thickness causing enhance contractility. The increased stroke volume is one of the primary adaptations contributing to improved cardiorespiratory fitness.  Cardiac Output Cardiac output (Q) is the total amount of blood that is pumped by the heart per minute.\n Cardiac output is the product of heart rate and stroke volume.  Cardiac Output = Heart Rate x Stroke Volume Q = HR x SV   Normal resting cardiac output is ~5 L/min. Cardiac output increases in response to exercise intensity, reaching maximal values of ~20 L/min due to increases in heart rate and stroke volume. As an adaptation to regular exercise training, cardiac output increases largely as the result of the increase in stroke volume.  Blood Pressure Blood Pressure (BP) is the measure of pressure exerted by the circulating blood against the walls of the arterial blood vessels.\n Blood pressure is the product of the cardiac output and the total peripheral resistance to blood flow.  Peripheral resistance to blood flow is influenced by:  Blood volume Blood viscosity (thickness) Inner radius of blood vessels Compliance of blood vessels (elasticity) Atherosclerosis (accumulation of fatty deposits)      Blood pressure is expressed in terms of both systolic and diastolic pressures.\n Systolic blood pressure represents the pressure exerted against the arterial walls during a left ventricular contraction of the heart.  A healthy systolic blood pressure at rest is    Diastolic blood pressure represents the lower pressure during the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle.  A healthy diastolic blood pressure at rest is        Classification Systolic (mmHG) Diastolic (mmHg)     Normal (Healthy)   Pre-Hypertension 120-139 80-89   Hypertension  140  90     During cardiorespiratory exercise, systolic blood pressure increases in proportion to the exercise intensity; whereas, diastolic blood pressure remains unchanged or may decrease slightly. As the result of regular cardiorespiratory exercise, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures may decrease at rest and in response to exercise. Regular cardiorespiratory exercise is effective as one strategy to reduce the risk of hypertension and to manage high blood pressure.  Respiratory System Respiratory Rate (fB) is the number of breaths taken per minute.\n Normal respiratory rate is approximately 12 breaths per minute, increasing four-fold to approximately 48 breaths/minute.  Tidal Volume (Vt) is the amount of air exhaled from the lungs with each breath.\n Normal resting tidal volume is 500 mL of air per breath. Maximal tidal volume, also called the vital capacity, is ~ 4 Liters of air per breath.  Pulmonary Ventilation (VE) is the total volume of air exhaled from the lungs per minute, also known as minute ventilation.\n Pulmonary ventilation is the product of the respiratory rate and the tidal volume.  Pulmonary Ventilation = Respiratory Rate x Tidal Volume VE = fB x Vt   Normal resting pulmonary ventilation is approximately 6 liters of air per minute, which can increase by a value of 15- to 25-fold during maximal exercise. In response to regular cardiorespiratory exercise, maximal pulmonary ventilation increases in part due to the attainment of a higher maximal workload. Pulmonary ventilation at submaximal intensities is generally not affected as the result of training, but may decrease in some individuals due to decreased lactate production.  During exercise, both respiratory rate, tidal volume, and subsequently pulmonary ventilation increase in response to the demand for more oxygen and to release carbon dioxide.\nGas Exchange In the lungs, the bronchi branch into smaller bronchioles, which divide is to an extensive network of alveoli.\n The alveoli are small sacs, clustered together like grapes, and surrounded by a web of capillaries. It is across the alveolar-capillary membrane that the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs between the air and the blood.  Oxygen Extraction Oxygen Extraction refers to the amount of oxygen that is removed from the circulating blood and taken into the skeletal muscle to support energy production.\n Oxygen extraction is also referred to as:  arterial-venous oxygen difference or (a-v)O2 difference   Oxygen extraction increases during exercise to accommodate the increasing demand for oxygen in the skeletal muscles. Oxygen extraction also increases as an adaptation to regular cardiorespiratory exercise. This increased capacity to extract oxygen from the circulating blood is the result of adaptations within the skeletal muscle including:  increased capillary density increased size and number of mitochondria, the ‘powerhouse' of the cell within which aerobic metabolism takes place, and increased aerobic enzymes and myoglobin    Oxygen Consumption Oxygen Consumption (VO2) is the amount of oxygen that is utilized by the body (muscles) during a specific level of exercise.\n Oxygen consumption is the product of the cardiac output and the oxygen extraction.  Oxygen Consumption = Cardiac Output x Oxygen Extraction VO2 = Q x (a-v)O2 difference   Oxygen consumption may be expressed as either liters of oxygen per minute (L/min) or milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (mL/kg/min). Oxygen consumption at rest is equivalent to 3.5 mL/kg/min, which is also known as 1 MET (metabolic equivalent). Oxygen consumption increases during exercise in direct proportion to the exercise intensity and the subsequent demand for oxygen in the skeletal muscles.  Maximal Oxygen Consumption Maximal Oxygen Consumption (VO2max) is the amount of oxygen that is utilized by the body (muscles) during maximal, exhaustive exercise.\n VO2max is the best indication of an individual’s cardiorespiratory fitness. VO2max is influenced by uncontrollable factors such as genetics, age, and gender, as well as controllable variables such as exercise habits. Maximal oxygen consumption increases as the result of regular cardiorespiratory exercise. Normal VO2max values may be ~35 mL/kg/min or 10 METs for deconditioned individuals; whereas, VO2max values among highly conditioned endurance athletes range from 70 to 80 mL/kg/min or 20-23 METs. The increase of VO2max observed with training is largely attributed to increases in maximal cardiac output and oxygen extraction.  Oxygen Deficit When starting exercise, the demand for oxygen quickly rises from rest to a level necessary to support the exercise intensity.\n However, the supply of oxygen, and therefore the amount consumed, lags behind this demand. The oxygen ‘missing' during the onset of exercise is called the oxygen deficit. In the absence of adequate oxygen during the initial minutes of exercise, energy is supplied by the anaerobic metabolic pathways. The oxygen deficit may be minimized by gradually increasing the intensity of exercise through a gradual warm-up period. When the oxygen supply matches the demand, then the exerciser is said to be at a steady state.    Oxygen Debt (EPOC) Upon termination of exercise, the demand for oxygen quickly returns to the baseline resting level; however, the oxygen consumption remains elevated for several minutes following exercise.\n The elevated oxygen consumption following the termination of exercise is called the oxygen debt - also called the Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC) The oxygen debt is necessary, in part, to repay the oxygen deficit accumulated during the onset of exercise. The oxygen debt is proportional to the exercise intensity such that higher intensities of exercise rely more heavily on anaerobic energy systems, thus creating a greater oxygen deficit.    Review of the Cardiorespiratory So, lets review the acute response during exercise as well as the longer-term adaptations to regular aerobic exercise training for the key variables of the cardiorespiratory system.\n  During exercise, heart rate increases in direct proportion to the exercise intensity.\n Both resting heart rate and the heart rate at an absolute submaximal workload will decrease as the result of regular exercise. Maximal heart rate is generally not affected by training or cardiorespiratory fitness.    Stroke volume increases curvilinearly during exercise, reaching it’s peak at about 50-60% of VO2max for most individuals.\n However, some studies have found that stroke volume continues increasing to near maximal intensity among highly trained endurance athletes. Resting, submaximal, and maximal stroke volumes increase in response to regular exercise, which is the primary central adaptation of the cardiorespiratory system.    As the product of the heart rate and stroke volume, cardiac output also increases during exercise in response to a greater demand for oxygen in the working muscles.\n As an adaptation to exercise, cardiac output at rest and an absolute submaximal workload may decrease due to an increased ability to extract oxygen from the circulating blood, subsequently decreasing the volume of blood needed to supply the same amount of oxygen. Maximal cardiac output increases as the result of regular exercise, largely due to the increased maximal stroke volume and a higher attainable maximal workload.    Blood pressure\n During exercise, systolic blood pressure increases proportionately with exercise intensity due to the increasing cardiac output. However, diastolic blood pressure remains unchanged or may decrease slightly during exercise as the result of decreased peripheral vascular resistance. Regular exercise and physical activity leads to a decrease of both systolic and diastolic blood pressures at rest and at an absolute submaximal exercise intensity. With training, one is likely to increase their maximum attainable exercise workload; therefore, systolic blood pressure at this new maximal intensity may increase and diastolic blood pressure may also increase, or decrease, depending upon the magnitude of maximal workload improvements.    Oxygen extraction increases during exercise due to greater activity of myoglobin and aerobic enzymes to meet the increasing demand for oxygen.\n As the result of regular training, oxygen extraction increases due to increased capillary density of type I muscle fibers, increased size and number of mitochondria, and increases in myoglobin and aerobic enzymes. Increased oxygen extraction is the primary peripheral adaptation to cardiorespiratory exercise.    As the product of cardiac output and oxygen extraction, oxygen consumption increases in direct proportion to exercise intensity.\n The resting oxygen consumption of 3.5 mL/kg/min does not change as the result of exercise training, but is achieved more efficiently through an increased stroke volume, decreased resting heart rate, and increased oxygen extraction at rest. Similarly, oxygen consumption across submaximal exercise intensities may be unchanged; however, it is likely that a decreased VO2 may be observed at submaximal workloads due to improved economy of movement. As the result of regular aerobic exercise, maximal oxygen consumption increases and VO2max is the best indication of overall cardiorespiratory fitness.      Bioenergetics Systems This section will review Bioenergetics, which is the metabolic pathways or energy systems that supply the energy needed to support muscle contractions during exercise.\nThe energy in the foods we consume does not transfer directly to the cells for biological work, but rather the energy from the macronutrients including carbohydrates, fats, and proteins is obtained from the energy-rich compound call Adenosine Triphosphate or ATP.\nTherefore, the energy for all biological work, including exercise, is provided by ATP.\nATP  The potential energy stored within ATP is hydrolyzed through a chemical reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme ATPase, during which ATP’s outermost phosphate is removed leaving adenosine diphosphate, an inorganic phosphate ion, and releasing approximately 7.3 kilocalories of free energy. Under normal resting conditions, about 80 to 100 grams (~3 ounces) of ATP are stored in the body. This represents just enough stored intramuscular energy to support a couple seconds of explosive, maximal exercise. There is a very limited supply of ATP stored within the body; however, only enough to support 1-2 seconds of maximal work. Therefore, several metabolic pathways are needed to resynthesize ATP to support continuous muscular work.  Energy Systems Continuum This continuum provides an overview of the various energy systems across increasing levels of intensity and duration of exercise. Each energy system will be presented in greater detail.\n   The Phosphagen System Substrate  Phosphagen system utilizes creatine phosphate, also called phosphocreatine, which is stored in the muscle fibers. The creatine phosphate donates its phosphagen to adenosine diphosphate in order to resynthesize adenosine triphosphate. This ATP can then be used to provide additional energy for muscular contractions.  Duration \u0026 Intensity  The phosphagen system serves as the dominant energy system supporting 1 to 10 seconds of very high to near maximal intensity exercise.  Activity  This is characteristic of speed and power-oriented activities such as short sprints or near maximal weight lifting.  Fatigue  Like ATP, there is only a limited supply of creatine phosphate stored within the body. Therefore fatigue during these very high-intensity activities is the result of a very rapid depletion of the limited supply of creatine phosphate.  Recovery  Recovery from a very high-intensity bout of activity is often achieved within 2 to 3 minutes during which time creatine phosphate is resynthesized in preparation for the next bout of activity. The phosphagen system produces 1 ATP for each molecule of creatine phosphate, so although the energy is obtained quickly, the overall supply of energy is quite limited.   Anaerobic Glycolysis  Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose. Anaerobic indicates that this process occurs in the absence of oxygen.  Substrate  Anaerobic glycolysis utilizes glucose circulating in the blood, or derived from glycogen, which are long chains of glucose stored within the skeletal muscle and liver, to produce ATP and supply energy. The process of anaerobic glycolysis occurs in the sarcoplasm of the muscle fibers resulting in the incomplete breakdown of glucose.  Duration \u0026 Intensity  Anaerobic glycolysis is the dominant energy system supporting high-intensity activities lasting from approximately 10 seconds up to approximately 2 to 3 minutes.  Activity  This energy system is characteristic of speed and strength activities such as middle distance sprints and resistance training. For example, running as fast as possible for 400 to 1,200 meters (1 to 3 laps around an Olympic track), or resistance training using a workload causing muscle fatigue within 6 to 20 repetitions.  Fatigue  During high-intensity exercise supported by anaerobic glycolysis, a concomitant accumulation of hydrogen ions within the muscle causes acidosis (i.e., decreased pH). This metabolic acidosis, not the accumulation of lactate, slows the process of glycolysis, disrupts muscular contraction, creates the ‘burning' sensation in the muscle, and ultimately causes muscle fatigue resulting in the slowing or cessation of exercise.  Recovery  Following a bout of high-intensity exercise, approximately 90-120 seconds of active recovery is necessary to buffer the acidosis in preparation for the next bout of exercise, such as a work interval or set of resistance training for the same muscle group. Anaerobic glycolysis produces 2-3 ATPs for each molecule of glucose.   Aerobic Glycolysis Substrate  Aerobic glycolysis utilizes glucose found in the carbohydrates we consume, circulating in the blood, or derived from glycogen to produce ATP and supply energy. The process of aerobic glycolysis occurs in the mitochondria within the muscle fibers. Thus, the mitochondria are often called the ‘powerhouse' of the muscle fiber. Aerobic indicates that this metabolic pathway requires the presence of oxygen.  Duration \u0026 Intensity  Aerobic glycolysis supports moderate to low-intensity activities lasting longer than 2-3 minutes.  Activity  These activities tend to be continuous and often repetitive in nature such as jogging, cycling, and swimming.  Fatigue  When relying upon this metabolic pathway for energy, many factors may contribute to fatigue including: dehydration, elevated core body temperature, a deconditioned state, and in the case of prolonged exercise lasting longer than several hours, depleted muscle glycogen stores.  Recovery  Recovery from aerobic activity generally occurs within 24 hours and is supported by adequate carbohydrate intake to replenish glycogen stores, fluid intake for rehydration, and rest for skeletal muscle recovery. Aerobic glycolysis produces 32-38 ATPs for each molecule of glucose.   Fatty Acid Oxidation Substrate  In addition to aerobic glycolysis, energy is also produced aerobically by way of fatty acid oxidation. Through this metabolic pathway, fats and fatty acids consumed in the diet, and stored within the skeletal muscle and throughout the body serve as the substrate for ATP, and subsequently energy production.  Duration \u0026 Intensity  In conjunction with aerobic glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation contributes to energy production during low-intensity activities spanning over an extended period of time.  Activity  These activities are similar to those characterized by aerobic glycolysis, such as walking, biking and swimming, although performed at a slightly lower intensity.  Fatigue  Fatty acids (i.e., triglycerides) are an extremely dense source of energy. Between 60,000 and 100,000 kilocalories is stored in the typical human body. This represents enough energy to support between 25 and 40 marathon runs. Therefore, depletion of fat is unlikely to cause fatigue. However, the metabolism of fatty acids is dependent on the breakdown of carbohydrates (i.e., aerobic glycolysis). As the saying goes, “fat burns in a carbohydrate flame.” Factors contributing to fatigue include glycogen depletion as well as other considerations similar to those associated with aerobic glycolysis.  Recovery  Recovery from aerobic activity generally occurs within 24 hours and is supported by adequate carbohydrate intake to replenish glycogen stores, fluid intake for rehydration, and rest for skeletal muscle recovery. Fat is a dense source of energy. A 16-carbon fatty acid such as palmitate yields 129 ATPs.   Metabolic Response to Exercise To a certain degree, at any given time each of the energy systems play a role in providing energy. However, the degree to which each of the energy systems contributes is dependent on the intensity and the duration of the activity.\n The initial 1-10 seconds of exercise are supported by stored ATP and the Phosphagen System. Anaerobic Glycolysis becomes the dominant energy system during the next 90-120 seconds of exercise.  Since the phosphagen system and anaerobic glycolysis are both anaerobic in nature, these energy systems correlate with the oxygen deficit that accumulates during the initial minutes of activity.   As the duration of exercise increases and the intensity decreases, the Aerobic Systems, including both aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, support continuous exercise lasting longer than 2 minutes.    Substrate Contributions During Prolonged Exercise Both carbohydrates and fats serve as the primary energy substrates to support ATP production during low-to-moderate aerobic exercise.\n As the duration of exercise increases and the intensity of exercise decreases, the percent of fat contribution to overall energy production increases. Although the percent of fat contribution increases with prolonged exercise, carbohydrates may still account for a greater total number of calories expended. The percent of calories (i.e., relative contribution to overall caloric expenditure) versus the absolute number of calories derived from each of these macronutrients has contributed to some misunderstandings regarding an ideal ‘fat burning zone'.    Carbohydrates vs. Fats The diagram below provides a graph comparing the fat and carbohydrate contributions during 30 minutes of walking at 3.8 mph compared to 30 minutes of running at 6.5 mph.\n    During 30 minutes of walking, the subjects' average energy expenditure was 240 calories, of which 144 calories were derived from carbohydrates and the remaining 96 calories from fat.\n During this walking activity, fat calories represent 41% of the total calories expended.    During 30 minutes of running, the same subjects' expended an average of 450 calories, of which 342 were derived from carbohydrates and the remaining 108 calories from fat.\n During this running activity, fat calories represented only 24% of the total calories expended, a much lower percent compared to walking.    However, although the percent of fat calories expended decreased with higher-intensity exercise, the total amount of fat burned actually increased.\n  In addition, the total number of overall calories expended also increased with higher-intensity exercise.\n  So, which activity is “better??”……”It Depends.”\n Many factors must be considered when selecting the most appropriate activity for a client. For example, the client’s goal, health history, current fitness and ability, physical limitation, and motivation. If the client is new to exercise, then low-intensity, low-impact activities such as walking may be more enjoyable, safer, and better tolerated. If the client is attempting to lose weight, then additional caloric expenditure may be attained through longer duration low-intensity activity, picking up the pace, or a combination of both.  Anaerboic Threshold Another consideration, and often a good indicator of one’s cardiorespiratory fitness, is the anaerobic threshold.\nAnaerobic threshold is the point, during progressively intense exercise, at which the body can no longer meet the demand for oxygen and must rely heavily on anaerobic metabolism to supply the needed energy.\n Since energy is supplied predominately through anaerobic glycolysis at, and beyond, this threshold, lactic acid production exceeds the body’s ability to buffer and remove blood lactate. Therefore, the anaerobic threshold is also sometimes referred to as the lactate threshold.  A more highly conditioned individual will cross this threshold at a higher exercise intensity, both in terms of absolute and relative intensity.\n This higher anaerobic threshold indicates a greater capacity for aerobic activity, and thus a higher level of cardiorespiratory fitness. For example, an untrained individual might currently hit their anaerobic threshold when running at 6.5 mph, corresponding to 70% of their VO2max. Following a period of training, this same individual, now better conditioned, may hit their anaerobic threshold when running at 7.0 mph, corresponding to 75% of their now higher VO2max. Now running at 6.5 mph is comfortably below their anaerobic threshold, and a sustainable aerobic pace reflecting their improved aerobic capacity.    Anaerobic threshold may be increased through proper training strategies such as interval training, which alternates short periods of high-intensity exercise with low-intensity, active recovery. (Cardiorespiratory training strategies, including interval training, will be presented in module five.)\nIncreased anaerobic threshold allows the participant to sustain higher-intensity exercise supported by aerobic metabolism; therefore, increasing performance and maximizing caloric expenditure.\nMuscle Fiber Types The final section will review muscle physiology including the characteristics of various skeletal muscle fiber types and the functions of the neuromuscular system.\nAlthough each skeletal muscle fiber is unique, they are often classified into three broad categories based on their metabolic and contractile properties.\n The three major muscle fiber type classifications include:  Type I - Slow Oxidative muscle fibers, a slow twitch fiber Type IIa - Fast Oxidative Glycolytic muscle fibers Type IIb or IIx - Fast Glycolytic muscle fibers    Both Type IIa and Type IIb muscle fibers fall within the broader fast twitch category of fibers.\nType 1 - Slow Oxidative Muscle Fiber (Slow Twitch)  Slow-twitch muscle fibers have a slower contractile speed compared to the fast-twitch fibers Type I fibers also produce a lower amount of force, yet have a high resistance to fatigue These fibers derive most of their energy from the aerobic metabolic pathways To support the need for oxygen, Type I fibers are also characterized by a high capillary density, a larger number of mitochondria, and a high concentration of aerobic enzymes and myoglobin Given their aerobic nature, Type I muscle fibers are primarily used during aerobic-type (i.e., endurance) activities such as walking, running, cross-country skiing, and swimming  Type 2b or 2x - Fast Glycolytic Muscle Fiber (Fast-Twich)  At the other end of the muscle fiber continuum, Type IIb (IIx) - Fast Glycolytic fibers are characterized by a fast speed of contraction, a high amount of force production, but a low resistance to fatigue Fast Glycolytic muscle fibers derive their energy from the anaerobic energy systems Type IIb or IIx, fast glycolytic fibers are used to support speed, strength, and power-oriented activities such as sprinting and power-lifting  Type 2a - Fast Oxidative Glycolytic Muscle Fiber (Fast-Twich)  Type IIa fibers are considered intermediate in their contractile speed and have moderately well-developed capacity for both aerobic and anaerobic energy production Although still considered a fast-twitch muscle fiber, they are more specifically labeled as Fast Oxidative Glycolytic Type IIa muscle fibers support moderate to high-intensity activities such as a set of resistance training exercise performed to 8-20 repetitions  Neuromuscular System Movement of the body requires communication between the brain and the skeletal muscles.\nNeuromuscular system includes all of the muscles in the body and the nervous system that controls them.\nThe nervous system is comprised of two distinct parts, the Central Nervous System and the Peripheral Nervous System.\n Central Nervous System (CNS) includes the brain and the spinal cord. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) includes the nerves that send and receive information throughout the rest of the body.  Motor unit is the functional unit of the neuromuscular system.\n It consists of the motor neuron, the branches of the neuron, called axon, and the muscle fibers they innervate. The Sliding Filament Theory explains the contraction of skeletal muscle. This begins as the central nervous system sends an electrical impulse, known as an action potential, down the axon of a neuron. When the impulse reaches the neuromuscular junction, chemicals called neurotransmitters are released, which transport the electrical impulse from the nerve to the muscle fiber, initiating a series of steps leading to a muscle contraction.     Summation is the accumulative effect of continuous electrical stimuli, or action potentials, resulting in a smooth muscular contraction without complete relaxation. The stimulation of additional motor units, and thus additional muscle fibers, is called recruitment.  As more fibers are recruited, the magnitude of muscular force increases.    Muscle Fiber Recruitment   When the electrical stimulation delivered by the central nervous system reaches the threshold necessary to activate the motor unit, then all of the muscle fibers innervated by that particular motor unit will contract. This is referred to as the all-or-none law\n  As greater external loads are applied against a muscle, the nervous system will activate additional motor units and subsequently recruit additional muscle fibers to increase the magnitude of force production.\n  Size Principle indicates that the smaller, lower threshold motor units, which are comprised primarily of Type I fibers, are recruited first.\n  The larger, higher threshold motor units comprised predominately of Type II fibers are then progressively recruited in response to the demands of exercise intensity and the need for greater force production.\n  The motor units found in the smaller muscles, such as the muscles that control the eyes, innervate a very small number of muscle fibers.\n  This allows for the neuromuscular control required to perform precise movements and fine motor skills.\n  Larger muscles, such as the major muscle groups of the body (e.g., quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals, pectorals) contain thousands of motor units each responsible for controlling hundreds of muscle fibers.\n  These muscles are better equipped for gross motor skills and greater force production.\n    ",

  <div class="post-content"><h1 id="section-1-anatomy">Section 1: Anatomy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-1-anatomy">#</a></h1>
<p>Section one of this module will cover human anatomy.</p>
<p>This section will introduce anatomic terms and definitions, and provide an overview of skeletal and muscular anatomy.</p>
<h2 id="definitions--terminology">Definitions &amp; Terminology<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#definitions--terminology">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Anatomy</strong> is the science of the structure of the human body.</p>
<p>There are many systems that comprise the human body. This section will provide an overview of the skeletal and muscular systems.</p>
<p>It is important to possess basic knowledge of human anatomy in order to design safe and effective exercise programs.</p>
<h3 id="anatomic-position">Anatomic Position<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#anatomic-position">#</a></h3>
<p>Anatomy begins with an understanding of the <strong>anatomic position</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the anatomic position, the body is standing tall, the feet are positioned hip-width apart, the arms are to the side with palms facing forward, and the head and eyes are looking directly ahead.</li>
<li>The anatomic position often serves as the point of reference from which structures of the body are named or located relative to other body parts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="anatomic-planes">Anatomic Planes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#anatomic-planes">#</a></h3>
<p>With some exceptions, the anatomic position also serves as the point of reference for movements of the body.</p>
<p>The body moves in three dimensions, each of with are defined by a specific plane of motion.</p>
<p>A <strong>plane</strong> is a flat, level surface extending into space. The three basic planes of motion include the <strong>sagittal</strong>, <strong>frontal</strong>, and <strong>transverse planes</strong>.</p>
<p>A specific movement of the body will occur in one or more of these planes of motion.</p>
<p>Imagine a plane to be much like a large pane of glass such as that found in a window.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>sagittal plane</strong> bisects the body into the <em>right and left sides</em> through the vertical midline or median of the body.</p>
<ul>
<li>A movement in the sagittal plane travels parallel to the plane, but does not cross it.</li>
<li>Movement in the sagittal plane travels <em>forward and backward</em>.
<ul>
<li>For example, from the anatomic position, <em>flexion and extension</em> movements typically occur in the sagittal plane of motion.</li>
<li>Some resistance training exercises that occur primarily in the sagittal plane include a biceps curl, triceps pushdown, seated leg curl, forward lunge, and narrow row.</li>
<li>Each of these exercises involved flexion and extension at one or more joints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>frontal plane</strong> divides the body into the <em>anterior and posterior sides</em> of the body.</p>
<ul>
<li>A movement in the frontal plane travels parallel to the plane, but does not cross it.</li>
<li>Movement in the frontal plane travels <em>toward or away from the sides of the body</em>.
<ul>
<li>For example, from the anatomic position, <em>abduction and adduction movements</em> typically occur in the frontal plane of motion.</li>
<li>Some resistance training exercises that occur primarily in the frontal plane include a lateral raise, side lunge, standing hip abduction, a lat pulldown, and a side bend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>transverse plane</strong> is parallel to the ground and separates the <em>upper and lower halves</em> of the body.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since this plane is positioned horizontally, it is sometimes also called the <strong>horizontal plane</strong>.</li>
<li>Movement in the transverse plane travels <em>horizontally around a vertical axis of rotation</em>.</li>
<li>Transverse plane movements often involve <em>rotation</em> such as turning the head from side to side, rotating the torso, or internally and externally rotating the shoulder around the vertical axis of the humerus.</li>
<li>Transverse plane movement also includes <em>abduction and adduction of the arms across the body moving horizontal to the ground</em>.</li>
<li>Some resistance training exercises that occur primarily in the transverse plane include a dumbbell chest fly, a reverse fly, external rotation of the shoulder targeting the rotator cuff, and a wide row.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="terms-of-position-and-direction">Terms of Position and Direction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#terms-of-position-and-direction">#</a></h3>
<p>At this point, it is becoming evident that learning anatomy is like learning a new language. The following will review some additional terminology that are fundamental to the understanding of anatomy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Anterior</strong> refers to the front of the body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Posterior</strong> refers to the back of the body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lateral</strong> refers to location away from the midline or median of the body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medial</strong> refers to a location toward the midline or median of the body</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the outside of the knee is the lateral aspect; whereas, the inside of the knee is the medial aspect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proximal</strong> refers to a location closer to the center of the body, the attached end of a limb, or the origin of a muscle. Remember proximal as being in <em>closer proximity to</em> the center of the body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distal</strong> refers a location further away from the center of the body, the attached end of a limb, or the origin of a muscle. Think of distal as being a <em>greater distance</em> from the center of the body.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the ankle is located distal to the knee and the knee is located distal to the hip. Or the knee is proximal to the ankle and the hip is proximal to the knee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Superior</strong> refers to a location above another body part and/or closer to the head</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inferior</strong> refers to a location below another body part and/or closer to the feet</p>
<ul>
<li>For example the shoulder is superior to the hip and the hip is inferior to the shoulder.</li>
<li>Superior is synonymous with higher or above and inferior is synonymous with lower or below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="skeletal-anatomy">Skeletal Anatomy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#skeletal-anatomy">#</a></h2>
<p>The human skeleton consists of 206 bones.</p>
<p>The functions of the skeletal system include:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing the supportive framework for the body</li>
<li>protecting the vital organs and the central nervous system</li>
<li>forming levers to produce movement with the muscular system</li>
<li>storing minerals (e.g., calcium)</li>
<li>producing red blood cells</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The bones comprising the skeletal system can be broadly placed into two sets, the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton.</em></p>
<h3 id="divisions-of-the-skeletal-system">Divisions of the Skeletal System<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#divisions-of-the-skeletal-system">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>axial skeleton</strong> includes the 80 bones of the skull, spinal column, sternum, and ribs. The primary functions of the axial skeleton are to provide the main axial support for the body, to protect the central nervous system, and to protect the organs of the thorax.</p>
<p><code>   Remember: axial is the main body's axis.</code></p>
<p>The <strong>appendicular skeleton</strong> includes the remaining 126 bones of the upper and lower extremities including the shoulder complex and the pelvis.</p>
<p><code>   Remember: appendicular refers to the body's appendages (arms &amp; legs)</code></p>
<h3 id="bone-tissue">Bone Tissue<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bone-tissue">#</a></h3>
<p>Bone tissue is soft at birth and hardens or <strong>ossifies</strong> as the skeleton matures into adolescence and young adulthood.</p>
<p>Skeletal tissue is comprised of a collagen matrix, which gives bone flexible properties, and mineral content (i.e., calcium and phosphates), which provides the stiffness.</p>
<p><em>There are two types of bones: cortical bone and trabecular bone.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cortical</strong> or compact bone is found mainly in the long shafts of bones and accounts for about 80% of all bone tissue.</li>
<li><strong>Trabecular</strong> bone is a spongy tissue having a lattice or honeycomb structure, and is found in the vertebrae, pelvis, flat bones, and ends of long bones.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bone is a dynamic tissue with the ability to grow and self-repair through a process called <strong>remodeling</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="bone-growth">Bone Growth<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bone-growth">#</a></h3>
<p><em>The bone matrix consists of three types of bone cells including osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Osteoclasts</strong> are bone-destroying cells that cause resorption of the bone tissue</li>
<li><strong>Osteoblasts</strong>  are bone-building cells that stimulate the formation of new bone tissue</li>
<li><strong>Osteocytes</strong> are mature bone cells that help to regulate bone remodeling</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bone remodeling</strong> is a continuous process involving the <em>coupled action of osteoclasts and osteoblasts</em>, in which</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>osteoclasts</strong> first resorb (i.e., breakdown) older bone and</li>
<li><strong>osteoblasts</strong> subsequently form and mineralize new bone.</li>
</ul>
<p>During periods of growth and maturation, the activity of osteoblasts exceeds osteoclasts, so bones grow, increase mineral density, and gain strength. After peak bone mass is attained, typically in the mid-to-late twenties, the activity of osteoclasts gradually outpaces osteoblasts leading to a loss of bone mineral density and strength. The rate of bone loss is influenced by genetics, hormonal factors, dietary habits, and other lifestyle behaviors. If the loss of bone mineral density becomes significant, it may result in osteopenia or osteoporosis.</p>
<p><em>Certainly it is not necessary to attempt to memorize the name and location of all 206 bones. However, it is important to learn the major bones of the skeletal system indicated below. These and other bones will be covered in this and other sections of this module.</em></p>

<h3 id="connective-tissue">Connective Tissue<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#connective-tissue">#</a></h3>
<p>Two types of connective tissue are also important with regard to both skeletal and muscular anatomy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ligament</strong> is a fibrous connective tissue that attaches bone to bone, providing passive support to joints</li>
<li><strong>Tendon</strong> is a connective tissue that attaches muscle to bone, allowing for the transfer of muscular force to the skeletal system</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="joints">Joints<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#joints">#</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>joint</strong> <em>(or articulation)</em> is the junction between two or more bones.</p>
<p>There are three major types of articulations in the body.</p>
<p>These joint classifications include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synarthrodial joints</strong> (also called <em>fibrous</em>) are held together by tough, fibrous connective tissue making them an <em>immovable joint</em> such as those found between suture joints of the skull.</li>
<li><strong>Amphiarthrodial joints</strong> (also called <em>cartilaginous</em>) are often connected by fibrocartilaginous tissue such as a pad or a disc, like the intervertebral discs found between the bodies of two adjacent vertebrae. Amphiarthrodial articulations are often <em>slightly moveable</em> joints.</li>
<li><strong>Diarthrodial joints</strong> (also called <em>synovial</em>) are <em>freely movable</em> joints and are the most common in the body.
<ul>
<li>These joints are also called <em>synovial joints</em> arising from their characteristic synovial membrane and the synovial fluid which lubricates the joint.</li>
<li>Synovial joints also contain articular cartilage and a joint capsule.</li>
<li>Examples of synovial joints within the human body include the shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Joints are also classified by their structure and function…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ball-and-socket joint</strong> is comprised of the ball-like head of one bone articulating into the cup-shaped socket of another bone, allowing for movement in all three planes of motion.</p>
<ul>
<li>The glenohumeral joint of the shoulder is an example of a ball-and-socket joint, where the head of the humerus articulates with the glenoid fossa of the scapula.</li>
<li>The hip is another example of a ball-and-socket joint, with the head of the femur articulating with the acetabulum of the pelvis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Condyloid joint</strong> resembles a reduced ball-and-socket configuration in which the oval-shaped surface of one bone articulates with the elongated or elliptical-shaped surface of another bone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given the elliptical shape of a condyloid joint, it is also commonly referred to as an <strong>ellipsoid joint</strong>.</li>
<li>Movement of condyloid joints occurs on two planes of motion allowing flexion-extension and adduction-abduction, but not rotation.</li>
<li>Examples of condyloid joints include the wrist, the <em>metacarpophalangeal or fingers joint, and the metatarsophalangeal or toe joints</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hinge joint</strong> is comprised of the c-shaped surface of one bone articulating with the rounded-surface of another bone, allowing one bone to swing around the other like a hinge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hinge joints allow movement in only one plane of motion represented by <em>flexion and extension of the joint</em>.</li>
<li>Two examples include the hinge joint of the <em>elbow and the knee</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saddle joint</strong> is characterized by the convex surface of one bone sitting in the hollow or concave surface of another.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although a saddle joint is limited in its ability to rotate, it does allow for movements in the other two planes of motion.</li>
<li>A somewhat rare example of a saddle joint is the <em>carpal-metacarpal joint of the thumb</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pivot joint</strong> allows only for rotational movement.</p>
<ul>
<li>This type of joint consists of the ring of a bone rotating around a process or projection of another bone.</li>
<li>The first two cervical vertebrae, named the <em>atlas and axis</em>, respectively, form a pivot joint under the base of the skull, allowing the head to rotate from side to side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two opposing flat surfaces of adjacent bones move across one another creating a <strong>gliding joint</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The inter-carpal joints of the hand and the <em>inter-tarsal joints of the foot</em> represent gliding joints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-spine">The Spine<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-spine">#</a></h2>
<p>The spinal or vertebral column consists of 33 bones, called <strong>vertebrae</strong>, which are categorized and named by region.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are seven cervical, twelve thoracic and five lumbar vertebrae.</li>
<li>The sacrum is comprised of five fused vertebrae and the <strong>coccyx</strong>, also referred to as the <strong>&lsquo;tailbone&rsquo;</strong> is comprised of four fused vertebrae.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spinal-column">Spinal Column<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#spinal-column">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>cervical spine</strong> consists of <em>7 vertebrae</em>, which support the skull and neck.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first two cervical vertebrae are called the <strong>atlas (C1)</strong> and the <strong>axis (C2)</strong>, which form a pivot joint allowing the head to rotate side to side.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>thoracic spine</strong>, consisting of <em>12 vertebrae</em>, articulates the ribs to support the thorax.</p>
<p>The <strong>lumbar spine</strong> consists of the <em>5 largest vertebrae</em> able to carry a significant portion of the body&rsquo;s weight.</p>
<p>The <em>5 vertebrae</em> of the <strong>sacrum</strong> fuse to form a single bone.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sacrum transmits body weight to the hip joints through articulation with the pelvic girdle, called the <strong>sacroilliac joints</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>coccyx or ‘tailbone'</strong> consists of <em>four fused vertebrae</em> and is functionally insignificant.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="intervertebral-discs">Intervertebral Discs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#intervertebral-discs">#</a></h3>
<p>The bodies of two adjacent vertebrae are separated by a <strong>intervertebral disc</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The outer portion of the disc is made of a several layers of tough fibrocartilaginous tissue with obliquely-oriented fibers called the <strong>annulus fibrosus</strong>.</li>
<li>The center of the disc contains a jelly-like substance called the <strong>nucleus pulposus</strong>.</li>
<li>The intervertebral discs serve an important function to absorb shock and dissipate ground reaction forces that arise from movements such as walking, running, and jumping.</li>
<li>The tough fibrous tissue of the discs is quite resilient to these forces; however, it is not uncommon for acute and chronic injuries to occur.</li>
<li>The cumulative effects of chronic poor posture and/or faulty lifting techniques may contribute to premature degeneration and weakening of the disc, eventually resulting in injury such as a bulge or disc herniation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional intervertebral joints are formed at the superior and inferior facets, also called <strong>articular processes</strong>, located on the two transverse processes of each vertebra.</p>
<ul>
<li>These facet joints function to limit motion and protect the spine from excessive rotation, lateral flexion, and shearing forces.</li>
<li>These joints may also become injured as the result of spinal instability, poor body mechanics or lifting techniques, and unsafe exercises.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-shoulder-complex">The Shoulder Complex<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-shoulder-complex">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="anterior-view">Anterior View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#anterior-view">#</a></h3>
<p><em>Review the diagram of the anterior view of the shoulder complex.</em></p>
<p>The shoulder complex is comprised of three bones including the <strong>humerus</strong>, <strong>scapula</strong>, and <strong>clavicle</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The shoulder, specifically the <strong>glenohumeral joint</strong>, is a ball-and-socket joint.</li>
<li>The ball-shaped humeral head sits in or adjoins with the shallow, saucer-like socket of the scapula called the glenoid fossa.</li>
<li>Because the head of the humerus is two-thirds larger than the glenoid fossa, the glenohumeral joint resembles a golf ball sitting on a tee.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>fossa</strong> is a broad <em>shallow area of a bone</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A fossa often serves as the attachment point for a muscle.</li>
<li>For example, the subscapular fossa of the scapula is the origin of the subscapularis muscle.</li>
<li>A fossa may also serve as an articulating surface with another bone, just as the glenoid fossa articulates with the head of the humerus.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>tubercle</strong> is a relatively <em>small projection</em> or bump on a bone.</p>
<ul>
<li>The greater and lesser tubercles are the insertion points on the humerus for the rotator cuff muscles.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>process</strong> is a <em>relatively large or prominent projection</em> on a bone, which also serves as the attachment point for muscles.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the acromion process and the coracoid process of the scapula.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="posterior-view">Posterior View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#posterior-view">#</a></h3>
<p><em>Review the diagram of the posterior view of the shoulder complex.</em></p>
<p>From this view, you can see the <strong>supraspinous fossa</strong>, which is the point of origin for the supraspinatus muscle, and the <strong>infraspinous fossa</strong>, which is the origin of the infraspinatus muscle.</p>
<h2 id="muscular-anatomy">Muscular Anatomy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#muscular-anatomy">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="classification">Classification<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#classification">#</a></h3>
<p>Muscles of various types throughout the body serve different purposes.</p>
<p><em>Muscle tissue is classified into one of three groups including cardiac, smooth, and skeletal.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>cardiac muscle tissue</strong>, which is found only in the heart, is <em>extremely efficient, fatigue resistant, and well-adapted to maintain the ongoing pumping action</em> of the heart.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cardiac muscle is <em>involuntary</em> since we do not maintain conscious control of this muscle action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another type of <em>involuntary</em> muscle is <strong>smooth muscle tissue</strong>, which <em>lines the internal organs</em> such as the stomach and intestines, as well as the blood vessel walls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Smooth muscle serves to move food through the digestive system and blood through the blood vessels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most abundant type of muscle in the human body is <strong>skeletal muscle tissue</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skeletal muscles are considered <em>voluntary</em>, since these muscles by and large are under our conscious control to accelerate or create movement, decelerate or slow movement, and stabilize or prevent movement.</li>
<li>Skeletal muscle is <em>primarily composed of water, which makes up ~75% of the muscle composition</em>.</li>
<li>Another <em>~20% of the muscle composition is contractile proteins</em> and the remaining <em>~5% includes high-energy phosphates, key minerals, and energy sources</em> needed for the production of force.</li>
<li>There are well over <strong>600 different skeletal muscles</strong> in the human body.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="composition">Composition<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#composition">#</a></h3>
<p>Skeletal muscle consists of long, cylindrical cells called <strong>muscle fibers</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscle fibers are bundled together into <strong>muscle fascicles</strong>.</li>
<li>Each muscle fiber is comprised of hundreds to thousands of smaller, threadlike structures called <strong>myofibrils</strong>.</li>
<li>Myofibrils are arranged parallel to each other and span the length of the muscle fiber.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/Muscle.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A gelatin-like substance called the <strong>sarcoplasm</strong> surrounds the myofibrils.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>mitochondria</strong>, known as the <strong>&lsquo;powerhouse of a muscle fiber&rsquo;</strong>, are found within the sarcoplasm.</li>
<li>The energy needed to support aerobic activity is produced in the mitochondria.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The myofibrils are comprised of even smaller contractile proteins called <strong>myofilaments</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The two myofilaments include <strong>actin, the thin filament</strong>, and <strong>myosin, the thick filament</strong>.</li>
<li>Each myosin filament is surrounded by six actin filaments.</li>
<li>These myofilaments overlap lengthwise to form a series of interconnected segments called <strong>sarcomeres</strong>.
<ul>
<li>The sarcomere is often referred to as <em>the smallest functional unit of the skeletal muscle fiber</em>.</li>
<li>The ends of each sarcomere are designated by a dense <strong>Z-line</strong>.</li>
<li>When examined under magnification, the overlapping of actin and myosin creates light and dark bands which, along with the Z-lines, give the skeletal muscle a striped or striated appearance.</li>
<li>For this reason, <em>skeletal muscle is also referred to as striated muscle</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sliding-filament-theory">Sliding Filament Theory<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sliding-filament-theory">#</a></h3>
<p>The widely-accepted <strong>sliding filament theory</strong> has been suggested as an explanation regarding the process of skeletal muscle contraction.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sliding filament theory states that when sufficiently stimulated by the nervous system, the small heads extending from the myosin filaments bind with the actin filaments creating cross-bridges.</li>
<li>The actin filaments are then pulled (called a power stroke), in a sliding fashion, across the myosin filament.</li>
<li>This sliding action brings the Z-lines closer together, shortening the sarcomere without the myofilaments themselves changing length.</li>
<li>As this sliding action occurs within the entire series of adjacent sarcomeres, the end result is a muscular contraction or shortening of the muscle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the stimulus from the nervous system is removed, the cross-bridges between actin and myosin will release and the muscle will relax to its normal resting length.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In order for this contraction to occur, the muscle must receive an impulse or action potential from the central nervous system, and an adequate supply of energy in the form of ATP must be available within the muscle</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attachments">Attachments<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#attachments">#</a></h3>
<p>Skeletal muscles attach to the bone via a tendon.</p>
<ul>
<li>The musculotendinous attachment that is located at the more stable end of the body segment, which tends to be located <strong>proximally</strong>, is called the <strong>origin</strong>.</li>
<li>The musculotendinous attachment that is located at the moving end of the body segment, which tends to be located <strong>distally</strong>, is called the <strong>insertion</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reviewing the shoulder complex, notice the biceps muscle:</em></p>
<ul>

<h3 id="actions">Actions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#actions">#</a></h3>
<p>Skeletal muscles produce the force necessary to move or stabilize the skeleton.</p>
<p>There are two main types of muscle actions during which force is produced: <em>isometric and isotonic</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isometric action</strong>, <em>the muscle produces force, but there is no movement and therefore no change in the muscle length</em>.
<ul>
<li>This is also sometimes referred to as a <strong>static contraction</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Isotonic action</strong>, <em>the muscle shortens and lengthens as force is generated to lift and lower an external load, respectively</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="isometric">Isometric<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#isometric">#</a></h4>
<p><em>Isometric exercises are performed in <em>static positions</em> involving no movement.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>During isometric exercises, the muscles exert force against
<ul>
<li><em>an immovable object</em>, such as pushing a wall;</li>
<li><em>two equal yet opposing forces</em>, such as placing the palms of the hands together and pushing; or</li>
<li><em>a static position is held</em>, such as the side-lying plank.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="isotonic">Isotonic<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#isotonic">#</a></h4>
<p><em>Isotonic exercises involve two phases of movement.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>During the <strong>concentric phase</strong>, <em>the muscle shortens as the external resistance is lifted</em>.</li>
<li>During the <strong>eccentric phase</strong>, <em>the muscle lengthens as the external resistance is lowered</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, when performing a dumbbell biceps curl:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concentric phase</strong> occurs as the elbow is flexed and the dumbbell is lifted toward the shoulder</li>
<li><strong>Eccentric phase</strong> occurs as the dumbbell is lowered in a controlled manner back to the starting position</li>
<li>In this example, the biceps provides the muscular force during each phase of the exercise, to both lift the dumbbell and to control the descent as the dumbbell is lowered with each repetition.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most common types of resistance training, such as free weights and selectorized machines, involve isotonic muscle actions to lift and lower a specific amount of weight.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a helpful hint when identifying the concentric and eccentric phase of a resistance training exercise.</p>
<p>When performing a resistance training exercise using an unchanging external load, such as a dumbbell, barbell, or plates on a selectorized machine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concentric phase</strong> always occurs as the <em>weight is lifted away</em> from the ground and</li>
<li><strong>Eccentric phase</strong> always occurs as the <em>weight is lowered back</em> toward the ground</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, descending during a dumbbell squat is the eccentric phase; whereas, ascending during the squat is the concentric phase. Similarly, lowering the barbell during a bench press is the eccentric phase and lifting the barbell upward is the concentric phase.</p>
<h3 id="functions">Functions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#functions">#</a></h3>
<p>Muscles are called upon to play a variety of roles during resistance training:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Agonist</strong> (also known as the <em>prime mover</em>) is the muscle or group of muscles that are primarily responsible for a specific movement</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the agonist or prime mover during elbow flexion, such as during a dumbbell curl, is the biceps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Antagonist</strong> is the muscle or group of muscles that work in direct opposition to the agonist</p>
<ul>
<li>The triceps muscle is the antagonist to the biceps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Synergists</strong> are one or more muscles that <em>assist the agonist</em> to perform a certain movement</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the brachialis muscle acts as a synergist during elbow flexion to assist the biceps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stabilizers</strong> are various muscles that also act to <em>prevent undesirable movement and to support a fixed joint position</em> during a specific exercise</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the muscles of the rotator cuff stabilize the glenohumeral joint, while muscles of the upper back stabilize the scapula providing a stable foundation for the shoulder complex and upper arm during an exercise such as the dumbbell curl.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be quite a tall task to learn the names and functions of over 600 muscles in the human body. With time, your knowledge of muscular anatomy will grow.</p>
<p>Although it is not necessary to learn every muscle in the body, it is important to have a good working knowledge of the major muscles throughout the body, their functions, and appropriate exercises to target the various muscles.</p>

<p>Derived from two Greek words, <strong>kinesis</strong> (meaning motion) and <strong>logos</strong> (meaning knowledge): <strong>kinesiology</strong> is the study of <em>human movement</em>.</p>
<p>This section on kinesiology reviews the joint actions and related muscle groups as well as common exercises related to basic human movement patterns.</p>
<h2 id="movement-terminology">Movement Terminology<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#movement-terminology">#</a></h2>
<p>Review the basic movement terminology…</p>
<p>From the anatomic position:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexion</strong> is decreasing a joint angle, bringing two body segments closer together</li>
<li><strong>Extension</strong> is increasing a joint angle, moving two body segments apart and returning back to the anatomic position</li>
<li><strong>Hyperextension</strong> is the continuation of extension moving beyond the anatomic position</li>
<li>In the anatomic position, flexion, extension, and hyperextension typically occur in the <em>sagittal plane of motion</em></li>
</ul>
<p>From the anatomic position:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abduction</strong> is movement of a body part, such as the arm or leg, <em>away from the midline of the body</em></li>
<li><strong>Adduction</strong> is movement of a body part <em>toward the midline</em> of the body</li>
<li>In the anatomic position, abduction and adduction typically occur through the <em>frontal plane of motion</em></li>
</ul>
<p>From the anatomic position:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rotation</strong> is a movement around the vertical axis of a long bone or around the axial midline of the body.</li>
<li>Rotation can occur to the right or left around the center of the body, or internally and externally around a bone such as the humerus of the upper arm or the femur of the upper leg.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next we will take a closer look at movements and their corresponding muscles or muscle groups throughout the body beginning with the shoulder complex.</p>

<h4 id="abduction--adduction">Abduction &amp; Adduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#abduction--adduction">#</a></h4>
<p><em>Abduction</em> is the movement of the arm away from the midline of the body</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting from the anatomic position, <strong>full range of motion</strong> for shoulder abduction is approximately <strong>180 degrees</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>middle deltoid</strong> is the <strong>primary muscle</strong> responsible for shoulder abduction</li>
<li>The <strong>supraspinatus</strong> also contributes to abduction through the <strong>initial 30 degrees of movement</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Adduction</em> is movement of the arm back toward the midline of the body starting from an abducted position</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting from the anatomic position, the arm is able to adduct approximately <strong>50 degrees</strong> toward the midline and across the body</li>
<li>The <strong>latissimus dorsi</strong> and the <strong>teres major</strong> are the <strong>primary muscles</strong> responsible for shoulder or arm adduction</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Both shoulder abduction and adduction occur primarily in the <strong>frontal plane</strong> of motion.</em></p>
<h4 id="horizontal-abduction--adduction">Horizontal Abduction &amp; Adduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#horizontal-abduction--adduction">#</a></h4>
<p><em>Horizontal abduction</em> is movement of the arm parallel to the ground, away from the midline of the body, through the <em>transverse plane</em> of motion</p>
<ul>
<li>From a neutral starting position, the arm is able to horizontally abduct approximately <strong>125 degrees</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>primary muscle</strong> responsible for this movement at the shoulder joint is the <strong>posterior deltoid</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Horizontal adduction</em> is movement of the arm (starting in the opposite direction), toward or across the midline of the body</p>
<ul>
<li>Again starting from a neutral position with the arm held directly forward and parallel to the ground, the arm is able to horizontally adduct approximately <strong>50 degrees</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>pectoralis major</strong> is the <strong>primary muscle</strong> responsible for horizontal adduction of the arm</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Both horizontal abduction and horizontal adduction occur in the <strong>transverse plane</strong> of motion.</em></p>
<h4 id="flexion--extension">Flexion &amp; Extension<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#flexion--extension">#</a></h4>
<p><em>Shoulder flexion</em> is the movement of raising the arm forward</p>
<ul>
<li>Primarily performed by the <strong>anterior deltoid</strong></li>
<li>Full range of motion for shoulder flexion is approximately <strong>180 degrees</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Shoulder extension</em> is movement of the arm (starting from a position of shoulder flexion), back to the anatomic position and posterior to the body</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to adduction of the arm, the <strong>latissimus dorsi</strong> and <strong>teres major muscles</strong> are responsible for shoulder extension</li>
<li>From the anatomic position, the shoulder is able to extend approximately <strong>50 degrees</strong> posterior to the body</li>
<li>Since this movement is a continuation of shoulder extension beyond the anatomic position, it may also be referred to as <strong>shoulder hyperextension</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Shoulder flexion and extension occur in the <strong>sagittal plane</strong> of motion.</em></p>
<h4 id="internal--external-rotation">Internal &amp; External Rotation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#internal--external-rotation">#</a></h4>
<p><em>External rotation</em> is rotation of the shoulder away from the body around the long axis of the humerus</p>
<ul>
<li>Two of the rotator cuff muscles, the <strong>infraspinatus</strong> and the <strong>teres minor</strong>, are responsible for shoulder external rotation</li>
<li>External rotation is also referred to as <strong>outward or lateral rotation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Internal rotation</em> is rotation of the shoulder toward the body around the long axis of the humerus</p>
<ul>
<li>Another of the rotator cuff muscles, the <strong>subscapularis</strong>, performs internal rotation of the shoulder</li>
<li>Internal rotation is also referred to as <strong>inward or medial rotation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The shoulder is able to externally and internally rotate to approximately <strong>80 degrees in either direction</strong>. In most cases, range of motion through external rotation is slightly greater compared to internal.</p>
<p><em>External and internal rotation occur primarily in the <strong>transverse plane of motion</strong>.</em></p>
<h4 id="scapular-protraction--retraction">Scapular Protraction &amp; Retraction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#scapular-protraction--retraction">#</a></h4>
<p><em>Scapular protraction</em> refers to movement of the scapula away from the posterior midline of the body</p>
<ul>
<li>The muscles primarily involved in scapular protraction include the <strong>pectoralis minor</strong> and <strong>serratus anterior</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Scapular retraction</em> is movement of the scapula toward the posterior midline of the body</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>rhomboids</strong> and <strong>middle fibers of the trapezius</strong> are primarily responsible for scapular retraction</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="scapular-elevation--depression">Scapular Elevation &amp; Depression<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#scapular-elevation--depression">#</a></h4>
<p><em>Scapular elevation</em> is raising the scapula as seen during a shoulder shrug</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>upper trapezius</strong> and <strong>levator scapula</strong> muscles are responsible for this action</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Scapular depression</em> is lowering the scapula back to their neutral position, which results from the pull of gravity, but also activation of the <strong>lower trapezius muscles</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Anterior deltoid</strong> performs shoulder flexion as seen during a front dumbbell raise</li>
<li><strong>Middle deltoid</strong>  performs shoulder abduction as seen during a lateral dumbbell raise</li>
</ul>
<p>Other resistance training exercises that target both the anterior and middle deltoid include a shoulder press and scaption, which involves lifting dumbbells with the thumbs pointed upward through a position approximately 30 degrees anterior to the frontal plane.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Posterior deltoid</strong> is primarily responsible for horizontal abduction of the shoulder as seen during a reverse fly using dumbbells, cables, or resistance tubing. <em>(The posterior fibers of the deltoid are located on the back of the shoulder.)</em></li>

<p><strong>Spinal flexion</strong> involves bending the torso forward, which is primarily performed by the <strong>rectus abdominis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Normal range of motion for spinal flexion is approximately <strong>120 degrees</strong>, which is distributed along the many segments of the spinal column</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spinal extension</strong> (starting from a position of spinal flexion) is movement of the torso back to the anatomic position and posterior to the body</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Flexion and extension of the spine and torso occur in the <strong>sagittal plane</strong> of motion</em></p>
<p><strong>Spinal rotation</strong> is the side-to-side twisting or turning movement of the torso through the center axis of the body</p>
<ul>

<h1 id="section-3-biomechanics">Section 3: Biomechanics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-3-biomechanics">#</a></h1>
<p><strong>Biomechanics</strong> is the study of the principles of mechanics, motion, and movement related to the biological systems of the body.</p>
<p>This section takes a focused look at how the human body moves with respect to the laws of physics, the physiology of human movement, and implications for safe and effective exercise.</p>
<h2 id="laws-of-motion">Laws of Motion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#laws-of-motion">#</a></h2>
<p>There are several natural laws that govern the external forces applied to the body and the corresponding movements that are generated by the musculoskeletal system. The most important laws as related to the study of biomechanics originate from the discoveries of a 17th century scientist named Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
<h3 id="law-of-inertia">Law of Inertia<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#law-of-inertia">#</a></h3>
<p><em>Law of Inertia</em> (Newton&rsquo;s first law of motion) states that <em>an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion</em> (in the same direction and velocity) unless an external force acts upon the object.</p>
<ul>
<li>In other words, an object that is not in motion (i.e., velocity = zero) will remain stationary until a force causes it to move.</li>
<li>The magnitude of this inertia is proportional to the mass of the object such that a heavier object (i.e., greater mass) will possess more inertia or reluctance to move.</li>
<li>Likewise, an object in motion will continue moving at its current speed and in its current direction until a force such as gravity, causes its velocity (e.g., speed and/or direction of movement) to change.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Inertia is the reluctance of an object to change its current state of motion.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>When the forces acting upon an object are equal</em>, the object is said to be in a state of <strong>equilibrium</strong>.</li>
<li>An object that is not moving is in a state of <strong>static equilibrium</strong>.</li>
<li><em>If an object is in motion without any change in velocity</em> (i.e., no acceleration, deceleration, or change in direction), then the object is in a state of <strong>dynamic equilibrium</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since many synovial joints throughout the body rotate around an axis of rotation, many movements of the body are rotational in nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Closely related to the law of inertia is the concept of <strong>rotational inertia</strong>, which refers to <em>the reluctance of a body segment or object to rotate around an axis of rotation</em> (e.g., joint).</li>
<li>Similar to torque, rotational inertia is proportional to the mass of the object and the distance of the object&rsquo;s center of mass from the axis of rotation or joint.</li>
<li><em>A heavier object located a greater distance from the axis of rotation possesses more rotational inertia (i.e., “reluctance to rotate”).</em>
<ul>
<li>For example, a baseball bat has less rotational inertia when held by the barrel of the bat (thick end) rather than by the handle since the bat&rsquo;s center of mass is moved closer to the axis of rotation in this position.</li>
<li>Likewise, when a little league coach instructs a player to ‘choke up on the bat', the strategy is to shift the bat&rsquo;s center of gravity closer to the body creating less rotational inertial and allowing the player to more easily swing the bat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="law-of-acceleration">Law of Acceleration<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#law-of-acceleration">#</a></h3>
<p><em>Law of Acceleration</em> (Newton&rsquo;s second law of motion) states that <em>a force applied to an object causes an acceleration of the object in the direction of the force</em> that is proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.</p>
<ul>
<li>The greater the external force acting upon an object, the more acceleration the force will generate.</li>
<li>Similarly, a lighter object subjected to the same magnitude of force will experience greater acceleration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once an object has been set in motion by an external force it is said to have <strong>momentum</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Momentum is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its velocity [M = m x v].</li>
<li>Momentum can be simply stated as <em>&lsquo;mass in motion&rsquo;</em>.</li>
<li>A heavier object will possess more momentum than a lighter object when both are traveling at the same velocity.</li>
<li>If two moving objects are of equal mass, the one traveling at the greater velocity will possess more momentum.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since many joints in the human body move around an axis, this rotational motion creates <strong>angular momentum</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Angular momentum is <em>generated by the mass of the object, the distance of the object from the axis of rotation, and the speed (velocity) at which the object is moving</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In other words, angular momentum is the product of the object&rsquo;s mass, the distance of the object from the axis of rotation, and the velocity of the object.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, when performing a kettlebell swing, more angular momentum is generated by:
<ul>
<li>Using a heavier kettlebell,</li>
<li>Having longer arms, and/or</li>
<li>Swinging the kettlebell faster</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequently, when a weight has <strong>more angular momentum</strong> it will require <strong>less concentric muscular force</strong> to keep the weight in motion whereas, a weight moved more slowly, therefore having less angular momentum, requires additional muscular force to keep it in motion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Conversely, a weight possessing more angular momentum will actually require greater eccentric muscular forces of the antagonist muscles to decelerate the movement of the object as the end-range of motion is approached.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="law-of-action-reaction">Law of Action-Reaction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#law-of-action-reaction">#</a></h3>
<p><em>Law of Action-Reaction</em> (Newton&rsquo;s third law of motion) states that <em>when an object applies a force to another object, there is an equal and opposite force back to the original object</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In other words, <strong>for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction</strong>.
<ul>
<li>While swimming, the individual pushes/pulls the water backward resulting in an opposite reaction force which propels the body forward through the water.</li>
<li>In another example, when walking, running, or jumping, the foot exerts force against the ground.
<ul>
<li>The ground exerts an equal and opposite force back against the foot which is subsequently dispersed throughout the body&rsquo;s kinetic chain (ankle, knee, hip, spine).</li>
<li>This is referred to as <strong>ground reaction force</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-lever-systems">The Lever Systems<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-lever-systems">#</a></h2>
<p>The bones and joints throughout the skeletal system act as levers to allow movement of body segments in response to muscular force.</p>
<p>The next section will review the components of a lever system and the three types of levers, highlighting examples found in the human body.</p>
<h3 id="terminology">Terminology<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#terminology">#</a></h3>
<p>Lever systems are comprised of three components: the fulcrum, the force, and the moment arm.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fulcrum</strong> is the pivot point of the lever system, also known as the <strong>axis of rotation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Force</strong> is the action upon an object or lever causing acceleration or deceleration of movement</li>
<li><strong>Moment arm</strong> is represented by the perpendicular distance from the fulcrum at which the force is applied</li>
</ul>
<p>During resistance training exercises, there are two opposing forces, one internal and one external, working within the lever system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal force</strong> is generated by the skeletal muscle, and is therefore called the <strong>muscle force</strong>. <em>(For example, the biceps muscle represents the muscle force.)</em></li>
<li><strong>External force</strong> is applied against the body and is called the <strong>resistance force</strong>. <em>(For example, the dumbbell represents the resistance force.)</em></li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/FRM.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>The internal and external forces act through a corresponding moment arm.</li>
<li>The moment arm, through which the muscle force acts, is called the <strong>force arm</strong>. <em>(For example, the force arm in this illustration is the perpendicular distance from the fulcrum to the insertion point of the biceps on the radius of the forearm.)</em></li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/ForceArm.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>The moment arm, through which the resistance force acts, is called the <strong>resistance arm</strong>. <em>(For example, the resistance arm in this illustration is the perpendicular distance from the fulcrum to the center of mass of the dumbbell held in the hand.)</em></li>
<li>Notice that the resistance arm is significantly longer than the force arm.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/ResistanceArm.png"/> 
</figure>

<h3 id="classes">Classes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#classes">#</a></h3>
<p>A lever system falls into one of three classes.</p>
<h4 id="first-class">First Class<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#first-class">#</a></h4>
<p>In a first class lever system, the muscle force and the resistance force act on <strong>opposite sides of the fulcrum, but are applied in the same direction</strong>. As such, a first class lever resembles a see-saw.</p>
<p><em>Of the two forces, the one positioned further from the fulcrum will have the mechanical advantage.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if the resistance force is closer to the fulcrum, then the muscle force will hold a mechanical advantage due to it&rsquo;s longer moment (force arm).</li>
<li>In other words, utilizing the advantage gained through a longer moment arm, the muscle force necessary to overcome the resistance force is lessened.</li>
<li>The mechanical advantage &lsquo;tips the scale&rsquo; in favor of the muscle force.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if the muscle force is positioned closer to the fulcrum, then the muscle will be placed at a mechanical disadvantage to the resistance force.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/FirstClass.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>An example of a first class lever can be seen as the skull flexes and extends in the sagittal plane through the cervical vertebrae.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first cervical vertebrae, called the atlas, serves as a fulcrum, the weight of the skull pulled forward by gravity is the resistance force, and the upper trapezius and cervical extensor muscles attaching to the base of the skull provide the muscle force.</li>
<li>When the head moves forward, as seen when someone sits with poor posture, the length of the resistance arm increases, placing the muscle force at a mechanical disadvantage, thereby increasing the force required of the cervical extensor muscles.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/FirstClassEX.png"/> 
</figure>

<h4 id="second-class">Second Class<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#second-class">#</a></h4>
<p>In a second class lever system, the opposing muscle force and resistance force act on the <strong>same side of the fulcrum</strong> with the muscle force working through a <em>longer moment arm</em> than does the resistance force. As such, the muscle force has the <em>mechanical advantage</em> since it has a longer moment arm through which to work.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/SecondClass.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>A wheel barrow is an example of a second class lever system.</p>
<ul>
<li>The significant mechanical advantage allows the muscle force to overcome much greater resistance force loads.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/SecondClassEx.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>An example of a second class lever can be seen during plantar flexion of the ankle, such as during the calf raise exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ball of the foot (distal end of first metatarsal) is the fulcrum, the body weight is the resistance force and the gastrocnemius and soleus deliver the muscle force via the Achilles tendon attaching to the calcaneus to perform plantar flexion, elevating the heel off the ground.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/SecondClassEx2.png"/> 
</figure>

<h4 id="third-class">Third Class<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#third-class">#</a></h4>
<p>In a third class lever system, the opposing muscle force and resistance force act on the <strong>same side of the fulcrum</strong> with the muscle force working through a <em>shorter moment arm</em> than does the resistance force.</p>
<p>In this lever system, the resistance force has the <em>mechanical advantage</em> since it has a longer moment arm through which to work.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/ThirdClass.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>An example of a third class lever can be seen during flexion of the elbow during a biceps curl.</p>
<ul>
<li>The elbow (radiohumeral joint) is the fulcrum, the dumbbell is the resistance force, and the biceps brachii delivers the muscle force via the tendinous attachment to the proximal end of the radius.</li>
<li>Since the dumbbell is much further from the elbow than the attachment of the biceps, the dumbbell works through a longer moment arm (i.e., resistance arm) and therefore the dumbbell holds the mechanical advantage.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Many joints such as the elbow, knee, shoulder, and hip function as third class lever systems.</em></p>
<h3 id="review">Review<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#review">#</a></h3>
<p>So, to review the characteristics of each of the three lever systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First class lever system</strong>, the muscle force and the resistance force act on <em>opposite sides of the fulcrum</em>, with both forces applied in the same direction.</li>
<li><strong>Second class lever system</strong>, the opposing muscle force and resistance force act on the <em>same side of the fulcrum</em> with the muscle force working through a <em>longer moment arm</em> than does the resistance force.</li>
<li><strong>Third class lever system</strong>, the opposing muscle force and resistance force act on the <em>same side of the fulcrum</em> with the muscle force working through a <em>shorter moment arm</em> than does the resistance force.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="biomechanics-of-torque">Biomechanics of Torque<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#biomechanics-of-torque">#</a></h2>
<p>When a force is applied to a distant point on a lever, a rotational movement around an axis of rotation occurs.</p>
<ul>
<li>This rotational force is called <strong>torque</strong>.</li>
<li>Torque is the degree to which a force rotates an object around an axis of rotation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defined quantitatively, torque is the magnitude of the force multiplied by the length of the moment arm.</p>
<ul>
<li>Torque = Force x Moment Arm</li>
</ul>
<p><em>During resistance training exercise, it is important consider both the external torque applied to the body and the internal torque generated by the musculoskeletal system.</em></p>
<h3 id="internal-torque">Internal Torque<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#internal-torque">#</a></h3>
<p>The torque generated internally by the musculoskeletal system is the product of the Muscle Force and the Force Arm.</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal Torque = Muscle Force (Mf) x Force Arm (Fa)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="external-torque">External Torque<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#external-torque">#</a></h3>
<p>The torque applied externally, in this case by the pull of gravity on the dumbbell, is the product of the Resistance Force and the Resistance Arm.</p>
<ul>
<li>External Torque = Resistance Force (Rf) x Resistance Arm (Ra)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the gravitational pull on the dumbbell is always downward, the length of the resistance arm, defined as the perpendicular distance of the resistance force from the axis of rotation, changes throughout the range of motion.</p>
<ul>
<li>The external torque is greatest when the elbow passes through ~ 90 degrees of flexion.</li>
<li>Although the mass of the dumbbell does not change, it will feel heaviest in this position.</li>
<li>As the dumbbell moves toward either end of the range of motion, the dumbbell feels slightly lighter since the resistance arm shortens resulting in less external torque.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/Torque.png"/> 
</figure>

<h3 id="practical-applications-of-torque">Practical Applications of Torque<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#practical-applications-of-torque">#</a></h3>
<p>During the triceps kickback exercise, as the dumbbell moves away from the perpendicular line through the axis of rotation, in this case the elbow, the length of the resistance arm will increase, subsequently increasing the external torque applied to the triceps muscle.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the elbow approaches full extension, the dumbbell feels heavier due to the greater external torque resulting from the increased resistance arm.</li>
<li>During this exercise, when the elbow is positioned at 90 degrees, the external torque on the triceps is minimal to nonexistent, therefore, the dumbbell applies very little load on the triceps, if any at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the difficulty of a resistance training exercise may be altered by selecting a heavier or lighter resistance.</p>
<p><em>In some cases, the difficulty of an exercise as determined by the external torque applied to the body, may also be manipulated by changing the length of the resistance arm.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, during a standing hip abduction exercise, using either resistance tubing or a cable column, the external torque may be decreased by moving the ankle strap or tubing closer to the hip, thereby decreasing the length of the resistance arm and making the exercise feel easier even though the resistance force remains the same.</li>
<li>A modification of this nature may be necessary when large increments of weight make it difficult to progress to the next level of resistance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applied-biomechanics">Applied Biomechanics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#applied-biomechanics">#</a></h2>
<p>The remaining section will review some of the key concepts of applied biomechanics including balance, stability, coordination, and the kinetic chain.</p>
<h3 id="balance">Balance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#balance">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Balance</strong> is the ability to control the position of the body against external forces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensory receptors throughout the body provide valuable information to the brain via the <em>afferent nerves</em>.</li>
<li>The central nervous system then delivers appropriate messages to the muscles via the <em>efferent nerves</em> allowing for adjustments in muscle recruitment and body position needed to maintain balance.</li>
<li>Many sports and athletic activities require a high degree of balance.</li>
<li>Activities of daily living may also require balance.</li>
<li>Older adults have a greater risk of falling due to a diminished ability to balance.</li>
<li><em>As such, safe and appropriate exercises designed to increase balance should be including within an exercise program, particularly for older adult clients.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stability">Stability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#stability">#</a></h3>
<p>Stability is closely related to balance.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stability</strong> is the ease with which balance can be maintained. Stability is influenced by the <em>base of support</em> and the <em>center of gravity</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Center of gravity</strong> is the theoretical point at which the body&rsquo;s mass is concentrated and balanced between all three planes of motion.</li>
<li><strong>Base of support</strong> is established by the body&rsquo;s contact point(s) with the ground or other stable surface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stability <em>decreases</em> as the center of gravity moves toward the outer limits of the base of support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stability <em>decreases</em> as the base of support is reduced (e.g., feet closer together or single leg stance).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stability <em>increases</em> as the center of gravity is lowered closer to the ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A heavier body is more stable than a lighter body when all other factors remain the same.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="coordination">Coordination<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#coordination">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Coordination</strong> is the ability to integrate several movements of the body simultaneously and sequentially to perform a complex task.</p>
<p>Many fundamental movements and skills are learned early in life such as walking, jumping, and throwing. Other movements require much more coordination and practice such as swinging a golf club to drive a ball down the fairway. The field of <em>motor learning</em> is dedicated to the study of this sub-discipline of exercise science. <em>The basic movement patterns to be included in a resistance training program include, squatting, pushing, pulling, and rotating.</em></p>
<p>When introduced to a new skill, movement, or resistance training exercise, many individuals will benefit from having the activity broken down into small components to facilitate learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>As these new skills are learned, the movements will become more fluid and synchronized requiring less thought and in many cases less effort.</li>
<li>With practice the movements become more efficient and seemingly effortless.</li>
<li>In resistance training, this effect is often called <em>neuromuscular education</em>, whereby the nervous system and muscular system ‘learn' how to coordinate the activation of appropriate muscles to produce smooth, synchronized movement.</li>
<li><em>Most of the strength gains observed during the early stages of a resistance training program are attributed to neuromuscular adaptations rather than muscle hypertrophy.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-kinetic-chain">The Kinetic Chain<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-kinetic-chain">#</a></h3>
<p>A final concept to review with regard to biomechanics is the kinetic chain.</p>
<p><strong>Kinetic chain</strong> is the series of interconnected segments and joints throughout the body.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper movement throughout the kinetic chain requires the integrated function of the skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems.</li>
<li>If any of the systems or components are disrupted, the remainder of the kinetic chain will be affected - ultimately impairing function and optimal movement.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="open--closed-kinetic-chain">Open &amp; Closed Kinetic Chain<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#open--closed-kinetic-chain">#</a></h4>
<p>Resistance training exercises may be categorized into either open or closed kinetic chain exercises.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open kinetic chain</strong> exercises are those during which the distal end (hand or foot) of the moving body segment is ‘open' in free space.
<ul>
<li>Open chain exercises tend to be single-joint movements, such as the leg extension machine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Closed kinetic chain</strong> exercises are those during which the distal end (hand or foot) of the moving body segment is in a fixed position and remains in constant contact with the surface, usually the ground.
<ul>
<li>Closed chain exercises tend to be multiple-joint movements such as the squat, which requires movement through the hips, knees, and ankles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="section-4-exercise-physiology">Section 4: Exercise Physiology<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-4-exercise-physiology">#</a></h1>
<p><strong>Physiology</strong> is the study of the physical and chemical processes, responses, and adaptations that occur throughout the body&rsquo;s cells, tissues, and organs during and as the result of exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bioenergetics, cardiovascular, respiratory, and neuromuscular systems each play an important role to support the demands of exercise.</li>
<li>Fitness professionals should understand the role each system plays and the significance of the changes that the body undergoes to accommodate the demands of exercise and conditioning programs.</li>
<li>At the end of this module you will be able to describe the physiological systems of the body and understand both the acute responses and long-term adaptations that occur within these systems during and as a result of exercise.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cardiorespiratory-system">Cardiorespiratory System<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cardiorespiratory-system">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Cardiorespiratory system</strong> is comprised of both the <em>circulatory</em> and <em>respiratory systems</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Circulatory system</strong> includes the heart, the blood vessels, and the blood.</li>
<li><strong>Respiratory system</strong> includes the mouth, nose, trachea, lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and diaphragm.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-pathway-of-blood-flow">The Pathway of Blood Flow<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-pathway-of-blood-flow">#</a></h4>
<p>To review the pathways of blood flow through the heart:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deoxygenated blood returns to the right atrium of the heart from all areas of the body and muscles via the veins, converging into the superior and inferior vena cava.</li>
<li>The deoxygenated blood moves from the right atrium to the right ventricle, by way of the right atrioventricular or tricuspid valve, and is then pumped to the lungs, via the pulmonary arteries, to be re-oxygenated.</li>
<li>The oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins and enters the left atrium.</li>
<li>The oxygen rich blood moves from the left atrium to the left ventricle, by way of the left atrioventricular or bicuspid valve, and is then pumped to the body and muscles via the aorta and arteries.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the tissue and muscles extract the needed oxygen, the deoxygenated blood returns to the heart via the veins and the process begins again.</p>
<h4 id="blood-vessels">Blood Vessels<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#blood-vessels">#</a></h4>
<h5 id="arteries">Arteries<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#arteries">#</a></h5>
<p>Oxygenated blood pumped from the left ventricle into the aorta travels through thick-walled <strong>arteries</strong> and the smaller <strong>arterioles</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The network of arteries and arterioles carry blood away from the heart to the target tissues and cells, such as the vital organs, skeletal muscles, and other tissues throughout the body.</li>
<li><strong>Arterioles</strong> play a significant role during exercise to regulate blood flow to the appropriate tissues through <em>vasoconstriction</em> and <em>vasodilation</em>.</li>
<li>During exercise, blood is re-directed to the working skeletal muscles to supply the needed oxygen and to the skin to dissipate heat.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="capillaries">Capillaries<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#capillaries">#</a></h5>
<p>From the arterioles, the blood flows into a microscopic network of smaller vessels called <strong>capillaries</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The capillaries are so tiny that some of the blood cells are forced to flow through the vessel single file.</li>
<li>The thinness of the capillary walls and the slow speed of the blood flow through these tiny vessels make them excellent for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the surrounding tissues.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="blood-flow-to-and-from-the-heart">Blood Flow to and from the Heart<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#blood-flow-to-and-from-the-heart">#</a></h4>
<p>Blood is collected from the capillaries by a network of <strong>venules</strong>, which deliver blood to the larger veins.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The venules and veins return the de-oxygenated blood back to the heart.</em></li>
<li>The walls of many veins contain one-way valves that help to maintain venous blood return to the heart by preventing back flow under the relatively low pressures.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="heart-rate">Heart Rate<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#heart-rate">#</a></h4>
<p>Heart rate (HR) is the number of beats (cardiac cycles) of the heart per minute.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Normal resting heart rate for an adult ranges between 60-90 b/min.</em></li>
<li>During exercise, heart rate increases in proportion to the exercise intensity.</li>
<li>Maximal heart rate is determined by genetics, age, and may be affected by medication, the environment, and other factors.</li>
<li>Adaptations to regular cardiorespiratory exercise are seen through a lower resting heart rate and a reduced heart rate response to a specific submaximal exercise intensity.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="stroke-volume">Stroke Volume<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#stroke-volume">#</a></h4>
<p>Stroke volume (SV) refers to the volume of blood that is pumped by the left ventricle with each heartbeat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Resting stroke volume for an adult typically ranges between 60-100 mL/beat.</li>
<li>During exercise, stroke volume increases curvilinearly in response to exercise intensity, reaching maximum values of ~100-120 mL/beat.</li>
<li>During exercise, the increased stroke volume begins to plateau at approximately 50% of maximum aerobic capacity for most individuals; however, in highly trained athletes, stroke volume may continue to increase during higher exercise intensity.</li>
<li><em>Stroke volume increases across submaximal and maximal intensities as the result of regular exercise training.</em></li>
<li>This increase in stroke volume may be attributed to increased end diastolic volume, increased blood plasma, greater diastolic filling time, and increased left ventricular wall thickness causing enhance contractility.</li>
<li><em>The increased stroke volume is one of the primary adaptations contributing to improved cardiorespiratory fitness.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cardiac-output">Cardiac Output<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cardiac-output">#</a></h4>
<p>Cardiac output (Q) is the total amount of blood that is pumped by the heart per minute.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cardiac output is the product of heart rate and stroke volume.
<ul>
<li>Cardiac Output = Heart Rate x Stroke Volume</li>
<li>Q = HR x SV</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Normal resting cardiac output is ~5 L/min.</li>
<li>Cardiac output increases in response to exercise intensity, reaching maximal values of ~20 L/min due to increases in heart rate and stroke volume.</li>
<li><em>As an adaptation to regular exercise training, cardiac output increases largely as the result of the increase in stroke volume.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="blood-pressure">Blood Pressure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#blood-pressure">#</a></h4>
<p>Blood Pressure (BP) is the measure of pressure exerted by the circulating blood against the walls of the arterial blood vessels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood pressure is the product of the cardiac output and the total peripheral resistance to blood flow.
<ul>
<li>Peripheral resistance to blood flow is influenced by:
<ul>
<li>Blood volume</li>
<li>Blood viscosity (thickness)</li>
<li>Inner radius of blood vessels</li>
<li>Compliance of blood vessels (elasticity)</li>
<li>Atherosclerosis (accumulation of fatty deposits)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Blood pressure is expressed in terms of both <em>systolic</em> and <em>diastolic</em> pressures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systolic blood pressure</strong> represents the pressure exerted against the arterial walls during a left ventricular contraction of the heart.
<ul>
<li><em>A healthy systolic blood pressure at rest is &lt; 120 mmHg.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Diastolic blood pressure</strong> represents the lower pressure during the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle.
<ul>
<li><em>A healthy diastolic blood pressure at rest is &lt; 80 mmHg.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>During cardiorespiratory exercise, systolic blood pressure increases in proportion to the exercise intensity; whereas, diastolic blood pressure remains unchanged or may decrease slightly.</li>
<li>As the result of regular cardiorespiratory exercise, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures may decrease at rest and in response to exercise.</li>
<li>Regular cardiorespiratory exercise is effective as one strategy to reduce the risk of hypertension and to manage high blood pressure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="respiratory-system">Respiratory System<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#respiratory-system">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Respiratory Rate (fB)</strong> is the number of breaths taken per minute.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal respiratory rate is approximately 12 breaths per minute, increasing four-fold to approximately 48 breaths/minute.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tidal Volume (Vt)</strong> is the amount of air exhaled from the lungs with each breath.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal resting tidal volume is 500 mL of air per breath.</li>
<li>Maximal tidal volume, also called the vital capacity, is ~ 4 Liters of air per breath.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pulmonary Ventilation (VE)</strong> is the total volume of air exhaled from the lungs per minute, also known as minute ventilation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pulmonary ventilation is the product of the respiratory rate and the tidal volume.
<ul>
<li>Pulmonary Ventilation = Respiratory Rate x Tidal Volume</li>
<li>VE = fB x Vt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Normal resting pulmonary ventilation is approximately 6 liters of air per minute, which can increase by a value of 15- to 25-fold during maximal exercise.</li>
<li>In response to regular cardiorespiratory exercise, maximal pulmonary ventilation increases in part due to the attainment of a higher maximal workload.</li>
<li>Pulmonary ventilation at submaximal intensities is generally not affected as the result of training, but may decrease in some individuals due to decreased lactate production.</li>
</ul>
<p>During exercise, both respiratory rate, tidal volume, and subsequently pulmonary ventilation increase in response to the demand for more oxygen and to release carbon dioxide.</p>
<h4 id="gas-exchange">Gas Exchange<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#gas-exchange">#</a></h4>
<p>In the lungs, the bronchi branch into smaller bronchioles, which divide is to an extensive network of alveoli.</p>
<ul>
<li>The alveoli are small sacs, clustered together like grapes, and surrounded by a web of capillaries.</li>
<li>It is across the alveolar-capillary membrane that the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs between the air and the blood.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="oxygen-extraction">Oxygen Extraction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oxygen-extraction">#</a></h5>
<p>Oxygen Extraction refers to the amount of oxygen that is removed from the circulating blood and taken into the skeletal muscle to support energy production.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oxygen extraction is also referred to as:
<ul>
<li><strong>arterial-venous oxygen difference or (a-v)O2 difference</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oxygen extraction increases during exercise to accommodate the increasing demand for oxygen in the skeletal muscles.</li>
<li>Oxygen extraction also increases as an adaptation to regular cardiorespiratory exercise.</li>
<li>This increased capacity to extract oxygen from the circulating blood is the result of adaptations within the skeletal muscle including:
<ul>
<li>increased capillary density</li>
<li>increased size and number of mitochondria, the ‘powerhouse' of the cell within which aerobic metabolism takes place, and</li>
<li>increased aerobic enzymes and myoglobin</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="oxygen-consumption">Oxygen Consumption<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oxygen-consumption">#</a></h5>
<p>Oxygen Consumption (VO2) is the amount of oxygen that is utilized by the body (muscles) during a specific level of exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oxygen consumption is the product of the cardiac output and the oxygen extraction.
<ul>
<li>Oxygen Consumption = Cardiac Output x Oxygen Extraction</li>
<li>VO2 = Q x (a-v)O2 difference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oxygen consumption may be expressed as either liters of oxygen per minute (L/min) or milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (mL/kg/min).</li>
<li><em>Oxygen consumption at rest is equivalent to 3.5 mL/kg/min, which is also known as 1 MET (metabolic equivalent).</em></li>
<li>Oxygen consumption increases during exercise in direct proportion to the exercise intensity and the subsequent demand for oxygen in the skeletal muscles.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="maximal-oxygen-consumption">Maximal Oxygen Consumption<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#maximal-oxygen-consumption">#</a></h5>
<p>Maximal Oxygen Consumption (VO2max) is the amount of oxygen that is utilized by the body (muscles) during maximal, exhaustive exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>VO2max is the best indication of an individual&rsquo;s cardiorespiratory fitness.</em></li>
<li>VO2max is influenced by uncontrollable factors such as genetics, age, and gender, as well as controllable variables such as exercise habits.</li>
<li>Maximal oxygen consumption increases as the result of regular cardiorespiratory exercise.</li>
<li>Normal VO2max values may be ~35 mL/kg/min or 10 METs for deconditioned individuals; whereas, VO2max values among highly conditioned endurance athletes range from 70 to 80 mL/kg/min or 20-23 METs.</li>
<li>The increase of VO2max observed with training is largely attributed to increases in maximal cardiac output and oxygen extraction.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="oxygen-deficit">Oxygen Deficit<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oxygen-deficit">#</a></h5>
<p>When starting exercise, the demand for oxygen quickly rises from rest to a level necessary to support the exercise intensity.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the supply of oxygen, and therefore the amount consumed, lags behind this demand.</li>
<li>The oxygen ‘missing' during the onset of exercise is called the <strong>oxygen deficit</strong>.</li>
<li>In the absence of adequate oxygen during the initial minutes of exercise, energy is supplied by the anaerobic metabolic pathways.</li>
<li>The oxygen deficit may be minimized by gradually increasing the intensity of exercise through a gradual warm-up period.</li>
<li>When the oxygen supply matches the demand, then the exerciser is said to be at a <em>steady state</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="oxygen-debt-epoc">Oxygen Debt (EPOC)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oxygen-debt-epoc">#</a></h5>
<p>Upon termination of exercise, the demand for oxygen quickly returns to the baseline resting level; however, the oxygen consumption remains elevated for several minutes following exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>The elevated oxygen consumption following the termination of exercise is called the <strong>oxygen debt</strong> - also called the <strong>Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC)</strong></li>
<li>The oxygen debt is necessary, in part, to repay the oxygen deficit accumulated during the onset of exercise.</li>
<li>The oxygen debt is proportional to the exercise intensity such that higher intensities of exercise rely more heavily on anaerobic energy systems, thus creating a greater oxygen deficit.</li>

<h3 id="review-of-the-cardiorespiratory">Review of the Cardiorespiratory<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#review-of-the-cardiorespiratory">#</a></h3>
<p>So, lets review the acute response during exercise as well as the longer-term adaptations to regular aerobic exercise training for the key variables of the cardiorespiratory system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>During exercise, <strong>heart rate</strong> increases in direct proportion to the exercise intensity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both resting heart rate and the heart rate at an absolute submaximal workload will decrease as the result of regular exercise.</li>
<li>Maximal heart rate is generally not affected by training or cardiorespiratory fitness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stroke volume</strong> increases curvilinearly during exercise, reaching it&rsquo;s peak at about 50-60% of VO2max for most individuals.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, some studies have found that stroke volume continues increasing to near maximal intensity among highly trained endurance athletes.</li>
<li>Resting, submaximal, and maximal stroke volumes increase in response to regular exercise, which is the primary central adaptation of the cardiorespiratory system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the product of the heart rate and stroke volume, <strong>cardiac output</strong> also increases during exercise in response to a greater demand for oxygen in the working muscles.</p>
<ul>
<li>As an adaptation to exercise, cardiac output at rest and an absolute submaximal workload may decrease due to an increased ability to extract oxygen from the circulating blood, subsequently decreasing the volume of blood needed to supply the same amount of oxygen.</li>
<li>Maximal cardiac output increases as the result of regular exercise, largely due to the increased maximal stroke volume and a higher attainable maximal workload.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blood pressure</p>
<ul>
<li>During exercise, <strong>systolic blood pressure</strong> increases proportionately with exercise intensity due to the increasing cardiac output.</li>
<li>However, <strong>diastolic blood pressure</strong> remains unchanged or may decrease slightly during exercise as the result of decreased peripheral vascular resistance.</li>
<li><em>Regular exercise and physical activity leads to a decrease of both systolic and diastolic blood pressures at rest and at an absolute submaximal exercise intensity.</em></li>
<li>With training, one is likely to increase their maximum attainable exercise workload; therefore, systolic blood pressure at this new maximal intensity may increase and diastolic blood pressure may also increase, or decrease, depending upon the magnitude of maximal workload improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oxygen extraction</strong> increases during exercise due to greater activity of myoglobin and aerobic enzymes to meet the increasing demand for oxygen.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the result of regular training, oxygen extraction increases due to increased capillary density of type I muscle fibers, increased size and number of mitochondria, and increases in myoglobin and aerobic enzymes.</li>
<li>Increased oxygen extraction is the primary peripheral adaptation to cardiorespiratory exercise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the product of cardiac output and oxygen extraction, <strong>oxygen consumption</strong> increases in direct proportion to exercise intensity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The resting oxygen consumption of 3.5 mL/kg/min does not change as the result of exercise training, but is achieved more efficiently through an increased stroke volume, decreased resting heart rate, and increased oxygen extraction at rest.</li>
<li>Similarly, oxygen consumption across submaximal exercise intensities may be unchanged; however, it is likely that a decreased VO2 may be observed at submaximal workloads due to improved economy of movement.</li>
<li>As the result of regular aerobic exercise, maximal oxygen consumption increases and VO2max is the best indication of overall cardiorespiratory fitness.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bioenergetics-systems">Bioenergetics Systems<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bioenergetics-systems">#</a></h2>
<p>This section will review Bioenergetics, which is the metabolic pathways or energy systems that supply the energy needed to support muscle contractions during exercise.</p>
<p>The energy in the foods we consume does not transfer directly to the cells for biological work, but rather the energy from the macronutrients including carbohydrates, fats, and proteins is obtained from the energy-rich compound call Adenosine Triphosphate or ATP.</p>
<p><em>Therefore, the energy for all biological work, including exercise, is provided by ATP.</em></p>
<h3 id="atp">ATP<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#atp">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The potential energy stored within ATP is hydrolyzed through a chemical reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme ATPase, during which ATP&rsquo;s outermost phosphate is removed leaving adenosine diphosphate, an inorganic phosphate ion, and releasing approximately 7.3 kilocalories of free energy.</li>
<li>Under normal resting conditions, about 80 to 100 grams (~3 ounces) of ATP are stored in the body.</li>
<li>This represents just enough stored intramuscular energy to support a couple seconds of explosive, maximal exercise.</li>
<li><em>There is a very limited supply of ATP stored within the body; however, only enough to support 1-2 seconds of maximal work.</em></li>
<li><em>Therefore, several metabolic pathways are needed to resynthesize ATP to support continuous muscular work.</em></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Phosphagen system utilizes creatine phosphate, also called phosphocreatine, which is stored in the muscle fibers.</li>
<li>The creatine phosphate donates its phosphagen to adenosine diphosphate in order to resynthesize adenosine triphosphate.</li>
<li>This ATP can then be used to provide additional energy for muscular contractions.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="duration--intensity">Duration &amp; Intensity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#duration--intensity">#</a></h5>

<h5 id="fatigue">Fatigue<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fatigue">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Like ATP, there is only a limited supply of creatine phosphate stored within the body.</li>
<li><em>Therefore fatigue during these very high-intensity activities is the result of a very rapid depletion of the limited supply of creatine phosphate.</em></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="recovery">Recovery<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recovery">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Recovery from a very high-intensity bout of activity is often achieved within 2 to 3 minutes during which time creatine phosphate is resynthesized in preparation for the next bout of activity.</li>
<li>The phosphagen system produces 1 ATP for each molecule of creatine phosphate, so although the energy is obtained quickly, the overall supply of energy is quite limited.</li>

<h4 id="anaerobic-glycolysis">Anaerobic Glycolysis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#anaerobic-glycolysis">#</a></h4>

<h5 id="substrate-1">Substrate<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#substrate-1">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Anaerobic glycolysis utilizes glucose circulating in the blood, or derived from glycogen, which are long chains of glucose stored within the skeletal muscle and liver, to produce ATP and supply energy.</li>
<li>The process of anaerobic glycolysis occurs in the sarcoplasm of the muscle fibers resulting in the incomplete breakdown of glucose.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="duration--intensity-1">Duration &amp; Intensity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#duration--intensity-1">#</a></h5>

</ul>
<h5 id="activity-1">Activity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#activity-1">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li><em>This energy system is characteristic of speed and strength activities such as middle distance sprints and resistance training.</em></li>
<li>For example, running as fast as possible for 400 to 1,200 meters (1 to 3 laps around an Olympic track), or resistance training using a workload causing muscle fatigue within 6 to 20 repetitions.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="fatigue-1">Fatigue<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fatigue-1">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>During high-intensity exercise supported by anaerobic glycolysis, a concomitant accumulation of hydrogen ions within the muscle causes acidosis (i.e., decreased pH).</li>
<li>This metabolic acidosis, not the accumulation of lactate, slows the process of glycolysis, disrupts muscular contraction, creates the ‘burning' sensation in the muscle, and ultimately causes muscle fatigue resulting in the slowing or cessation of exercise.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="recovery-1">Recovery<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recovery-1">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Following a bout of high-intensity exercise, approximately 90-120 seconds of active recovery is necessary to buffer the acidosis in preparation for the next bout of exercise, such as a work interval or set of resistance training for the same muscle group.</li>
<li>Anaerobic glycolysis produces 2-3 ATPs for each molecule of glucose.</li>

<ul>
<li>Aerobic glycolysis utilizes glucose found in the carbohydrates we consume, circulating in the blood, or derived from glycogen to produce ATP and supply energy.</li>
<li>The process of aerobic glycolysis occurs in the mitochondria within the muscle fibers.</li>
<li>Thus, the mitochondria are often called the ‘powerhouse' of the muscle fiber.</li>

<ul>
<li>When relying upon this metabolic pathway for energy, many factors may contribute to fatigue including: dehydration, elevated core body temperature, a deconditioned state, and in the case of prolonged exercise lasting longer than several hours, depleted muscle glycogen stores.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="recovery-2">Recovery<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recovery-2">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Recovery from aerobic activity generally occurs within 24 hours and is supported by adequate carbohydrate intake to replenish glycogen stores, fluid intake for rehydration, and rest for skeletal muscle recovery.</li>

<ul>
<li>In addition to aerobic glycolysis, energy is also produced aerobically by way of fatty acid oxidation.</li>
<li>Through this metabolic pathway, fats and fatty acids consumed in the diet, and stored within the skeletal muscle and throughout the body serve as the substrate for ATP, and subsequently energy production.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="duration--intensity-3">Duration &amp; Intensity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#duration--intensity-3">#</a></h5>

</ul>
<h5 id="activity-3">Activity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#activity-3">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li><em>These activities are similar to those characterized by aerobic glycolysis, such as walking, biking and swimming, although performed at a slightly lower intensity.</em></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="fatigue-3">Fatigue<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fatigue-3">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Fatty acids (i.e., triglycerides) are an extremely dense source of energy.</li>
<li>Between 60,000 and 100,000 kilocalories is stored in the typical human body.</li>
<li>This represents enough energy to support between 25 and 40 marathon runs.</li>
<li>Therefore, depletion of fat is unlikely to cause fatigue.</li>
<li>However, the metabolism of fatty acids is dependent on the breakdown of carbohydrates (i.e., aerobic glycolysis).</li>
<li>As the saying goes, “fat burns in a carbohydrate flame.”</li>
<li>Factors contributing to fatigue include glycogen depletion as well as other considerations similar to those associated with aerobic glycolysis.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="recovery-3">Recovery<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recovery-3">#</a></h5>

<li>Fat is a dense source of energy.</li>
<li>A 16-carbon fatty acid such as palmitate yields 129 ATPs.</li>

<p>To a certain degree, at any given time each of the energy systems play a role in providing energy. However, the degree to which each of the energy systems contributes is dependent on the intensity and the duration of the activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial <em>1-10 seconds</em> of exercise are supported by stored ATP and the <strong>Phosphagen System</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Anaerobic Glycolysis</strong> becomes the dominant energy system during the next <em>90-120 seconds</em> of exercise.
<ul>
<li>Since the phosphagen system and anaerobic glycolysis are both anaerobic in nature, these energy systems correlate with the oxygen deficit that accumulates during the initial minutes of activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As the duration of exercise increases and the intensity decreases, the <strong>Aerobic Systems</strong>, including both <em>aerobic glycolysis</em> and <em>fatty acid oxidation</em>, support continuous exercise lasting <em>longer than 2 minutes</em>.</li>

<h3 id="substrate-contributions-during-prolonged-exercise">Substrate Contributions During Prolonged Exercise<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#substrate-contributions-during-prolonged-exercise">#</a></h3>
<p>Both carbohydrates and fats serve as the primary energy substrates to support ATP production during low-to-moderate aerobic exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the duration of exercise increases and the intensity of exercise decreases, the percent of fat contribution to overall energy production increases.</li>
<li>Although the percent of fat contribution increases with prolonged exercise, carbohydrates may still account for a greater total number of calories expended.</li>
<li>The percent of calories (i.e., relative contribution to overall caloric expenditure) versus the absolute number of calories derived from each of these macronutrients has contributed to some misunderstandings regarding an ideal ‘fat burning zone'.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="carbohydrates-vs-fats">Carbohydrates vs. Fats<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#carbohydrates-vs-fats">#</a></h4>
<p>The diagram below provides a graph comparing the fat and carbohydrate contributions during 30 minutes of walking at 3.8 mph compared to 30 minutes of running at 6.5 mph.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/FatsVsCarbs.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>
<p>During <strong>30 minutes of walking</strong>, the subjects' average energy expenditure was 240 calories, of which 144 calories were derived from carbohydrates and the remaining 96 calories from fat.</p>
<ul>
<li>During this walking activity, fat calories represent 41% of the total calories expended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>During <strong>30 minutes of running</strong>, the same subjects' expended an average of 450 calories, of which 342 were derived from carbohydrates and the remaining 108 calories from fat.</p>
<ul>
<li>During this running activity, fat calories represented only 24% of the total calories expended, a much lower percent compared to walking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, although the percent of fat calories expended decreased with higher-intensity exercise, the total amount of fat burned actually increased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the total number of overall calories expended also increased with higher-intensity exercise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, which activity is &ldquo;better??&rdquo;&hellip;&hellip;”It Depends.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Many factors must be considered when selecting the most appropriate activity for a client.</li>
<li>For example, the client&rsquo;s goal, health history, current fitness and ability, physical limitation, and motivation.</li>
<li>If the client is new to exercise, then low-intensity, low-impact activities such as walking may be more enjoyable, safer, and better tolerated.</li>
<li>If the client is attempting to lose weight, then additional caloric expenditure may be attained through longer duration low-intensity activity, picking up the pace, or a combination of both.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="anaerboic-threshold">Anaerboic Threshold<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#anaerboic-threshold">#</a></h3>
<p>Another consideration, and often a good indicator of one&rsquo;s cardiorespiratory fitness, is the anaerobic threshold.</p>
<p><strong>Anaerobic threshold</strong> is the point, during progressively intense exercise, at which the body can no longer meet the demand for oxygen and must rely heavily on anaerobic metabolism to supply the needed energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since energy is supplied predominately through anaerobic glycolysis at, and beyond, this threshold, <strong>lactic acid</strong> production exceeds the body&rsquo;s ability to buffer and remove blood lactate.</li>
<li>Therefore, the anaerobic threshold is also sometimes referred to as the <em>lactate threshold</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A more highly conditioned individual will cross this threshold at a higher exercise intensity, both in terms of absolute and relative intensity.</p>
<ul>
<li>This higher anaerobic threshold indicates a greater capacity for aerobic activity, and thus a higher level of cardiorespiratory fitness.</li>
<li>For example, an untrained individual might currently hit their anaerobic threshold when running at 6.5 mph, corresponding to 70% of their VO2max.</li>
<li>Following a period of training, this same individual, now better conditioned, may hit their anaerobic threshold when running at 7.0 mph, corresponding to 75% of their now higher VO2max.</li>
<li>Now running at 6.5 mph is comfortably below their anaerobic threshold, and a sustainable aerobic pace reflecting their improved aerobic capacity.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/AnaerobicThresh.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>Anaerobic threshold may be increased through proper training strategies such as interval training, which alternates short periods of high-intensity exercise with low-intensity, active recovery. (Cardiorespiratory training strategies, including interval training, will be presented in module five.)</p>
<p>Increased anaerobic threshold allows the participant to sustain higher-intensity exercise supported by aerobic metabolism; therefore, increasing performance and maximizing caloric expenditure.</p>
<h2 id="muscle-fiber-types">Muscle Fiber Types<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#muscle-fiber-types">#</a></h2>
<p>The final section will review muscle physiology including the characteristics of various skeletal muscle fiber types and the functions of the neuromuscular system.</p>
<p>Although each skeletal muscle fiber is unique, they are often classified into three broad categories based on their metabolic and contractile properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>The three major muscle fiber type classifications include:
<ul>
<li>Type I - Slow Oxidative muscle fibers, a slow twitch fiber</li>
<li>Type IIa - Fast Oxidative Glycolytic muscle fibers</li>
<li>Type IIb or IIx - Fast Glycolytic muscle fibers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Both Type IIa and Type IIb muscle fibers fall within the broader fast twitch category of fibers.</em></p>
<h3 id="type-1---slow-oxidative-muscle-fiber-slow-twitch">Type 1 - Slow Oxidative Muscle Fiber (Slow Twitch)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#type-1---slow-oxidative-muscle-fiber-slow-twitch">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Slow-twitch muscle fibers have a slower contractile speed compared to the fast-twitch fibers</li>
<li>Type I fibers also <strong>produce a lower amount of force, yet have a high resistance to fatigue</strong></li>
<li>These fibers derive most of their energy from the <strong>aerobic metabolic pathways</strong></li>
<li>To support the need for oxygen, Type I fibers are also characterized by a high capillary density, a larger number of mitochondria, and a high concentration of aerobic enzymes and myoglobin</li>
<li>Given their aerobic nature, Type I muscle fibers are <strong>primarily used during aerobic-type (i.e., endurance) activities such as walking, running, cross-country skiing, and swimming</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="type-2b-or-2x---fast-glycolytic-muscle-fiber-fast-twich">Type 2b or 2x - Fast Glycolytic Muscle Fiber (Fast-Twich)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#type-2b-or-2x---fast-glycolytic-muscle-fiber-fast-twich">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>At the other end of the muscle fiber continuum, Type IIb (IIx) - Fast Glycolytic fibers are characterized by a <strong>fast speed of contraction, a high amount of force production, but a low resistance to fatigue</strong></li>
<li>Fast Glycolytic muscle fibers derive their energy from the <strong>anaerobic energy systems</strong></li>
<li>Type IIb or IIx, fast glycolytic fibers are used to support <strong>speed, strength, and power-oriented activities such as sprinting and power-lifting</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="type-2a---fast-oxidative-glycolytic-muscle-fiber-fast-twich">Type 2a - Fast Oxidative Glycolytic Muscle Fiber (Fast-Twich)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#type-2a---fast-oxidative-glycolytic-muscle-fiber-fast-twich">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type IIa fibers are considered intermediate in their contractile speed and have moderately well-developed capacity for <strong>both aerobic and anaerobic energy production</strong></li>
<li>Although still considered a fast-twitch muscle fiber, they are more specifically labeled as <em>Fast Oxidative Glycolytic</em></li>
<li>Type IIa muscle fibers <strong>support moderate to high-intensity activities such as a set of resistance training exercise performed to 8-20 repetitions</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="neuromuscular-system">Neuromuscular System<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#neuromuscular-system">#</a></h2>
<p>Movement of the body requires communication between the brain and the skeletal muscles.</p>
<p><strong>Neuromuscular system</strong> includes all of the muscles in the body and the nervous system that controls them.</p>
<p><em>The nervous system is comprised of two distinct parts, the Central Nervous System and the Peripheral Nervous System.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Central Nervous System (CNS)</strong> includes the brain and the spinal cord.</li>
<li><strong>Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)</strong> includes the nerves that send and receive information throughout the rest of the body.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motor unit</strong> is the functional unit of the neuromuscular system.</p>
<ul>
<li>It consists of the motor neuron, the branches of the neuron, called <em>axon</em>, and the muscle fibers they innervate.</li>
<li><em>The Sliding Filament Theory explains the contraction of skeletal muscle.</em></li>
<li>This begins as the central nervous system sends an electrical impulse, known as an <em>action potential</em>, down the axon of a neuron.</li>
<li>When the impulse reaches the neuromuscular junction, chemicals called <em>neurotransmitters</em> are released, which transport the electrical impulse from the nerve to the muscle fiber, initiating a series of steps leading to a muscle contraction.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod2/MotorUnit.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li><em>Summation</em> is the accumulative effect of continuous electrical stimuli, or action potentials, resulting in a smooth muscular contraction without complete relaxation.</li>
<li>The stimulation of additional motor units, and thus additional muscle fibers, is called <strong>recruitment</strong>.
<ul>
<li>As more fibers are recruited, the magnitude of muscular force increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="muscle-fiber-recruitment">Muscle Fiber Recruitment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#muscle-fiber-recruitment">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the electrical stimulation delivered by the central nervous system reaches the threshold necessary to activate the motor unit, then all of the muscle fibers innervated by that particular motor unit will contract. <em>This is referred to as the <strong>all-or-none law</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As greater external loads are applied against a muscle, the nervous system will activate additional motor units and subsequently recruit additional muscle fibers to increase the magnitude of force production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Size Principle</strong> indicates that the smaller, lower threshold motor units, which are comprised primarily of Type I fibers, are recruited first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The larger, higher threshold motor units comprised predominately of Type II fibers are then progressively recruited in response to the demands of exercise intensity and the need for greater force production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The motor units found in the smaller muscles, such as the muscles that control the eyes, innervate a very small number of muscle fibers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This allows for the neuromuscular control required to perform precise movements and fine motor skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Larger muscles, such as the major muscle groups of the body (e.g., quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals, pectorals) contain thousands of motor units each responsible for controlling hundreds of muscle fibers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These muscles are better equipped for gross motor skills and greater force production.</p>
</li>
</ul>
