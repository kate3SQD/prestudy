  "articleBody": "Section 1: Special Populations Section one will review exercise programing considerations and guidelines for special populations including women during pregnancy and the postpartum period, older adults, and youth and adolescents.\nPregnancy Physical Activity \u0026 Exercise Women with uncomplicated pregnancies should be encouraged to engage in aerobic and strength-oriented exercises before, during, and after pregnancy.\n Regular physical activity during pregnancy improves or maintains physical fitness, helps with weight management, reduces the risk of gestational diabetes in obese women, and enhances psychologic well-being. According to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, healthy women who are not already highly active or doing vigorous-intensity activity should get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In addition, pregnant women who habitually engage in vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or are highly active can continue physical activity during pregnancy and the postpartum period, provided that they remain healthy and discuss with their health care provider how and when activity should be adjusted over time.  Exercise Contraindications \u0026 Warning Signs Physical activity during uncomplicated pregnancy is both safe and desirable. Healthy women should be encouraged to exercise throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period. However, in some cases exercise may be unsafe during pregnancy. Women should consult with their health care provider throughout pregnancy to determine the appropriateness of exercise or the need for exercise modification.\nRelative contraindications are those that present some risk, which must be weighed against the benefits of physical activity to determine if exercise may be appropriate.\n Relative contraindications for exercise during pregnancy include:  anemia unevaluated maternal cardiac arrhythmia chronic bronchitis poorly controlled type 1 diabetes extreme morbid obesity extreme underweight (i.e., BMI history of extremely sedentary lifestyle intrauterine growth restriction in current pregnancy poorly controlled hypertension seizure disorder hyperthyroidism orthopedic limitations heavy smoking    Absolute contraindications are those conditions that make exercise inappropriate or require exercise to be terminated during pregnancy.\n Absolute contraindications for exercise during pregnancy include:  hemodynamically significant heart disease restrictive lung disease incompetent cervix or cerclage multiple gestation at risk of premature labor persistent second- or third-trimester bleeding placenta previa after 26 weeks of gestation premature labor during the current pregnancy ruptured membranes preeclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension severe anemia    In addition to exercise contraindications, it is important educate pregnant clients regarding warning signs to discontinue exercise during pregnancy.\n Warning signs include:  vaginal bleeding regular painful contractions amniotic fluid leakage dyspnea before exertion dizziness headache chest pain muscle weakness affecting balance calf pain or swelling    Exercise Considerations The principles of exercise prescription for healthy pregnant women do not differ from those for the general population. However, some special considerations should be noted with regard to exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period:\n Heart rate response to exercise may be blunted in pregnant women; therefore, the use of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) may be a more effective means to monitor exercise intensity during pregnancy. Due to the weight of the growing fetus, exercise for prolonged periods in the supine position may reduce venous return and cardiac output; therefore, exercise in the supine position after the 16th week of pregnancy should be avoided. During any exercise or activity, women who are pregnant should avoid using the Valsalva maneuver, prolonged isometric contractions, and motionless standing. High-intensity or prolonged exercise in excess of 45 minutes can lead to hypoglycemia; therefore, adequate caloric intake before exercise, or limiting the intensity or duration of exercise, is necessary to minimize risk. Pelvic floor exercises (e.g., Kegels) are recommended during pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period to decrease the risk of incontinence. Women who are pregnant should avoid exercising in a hot humid environment, stay well hydrated at all times, and dress appropriately to minimize the risk of heat stress. Pregnant women should avoid contact sports and activities that may cause a loss of balance or trauma to the mother or fetus. In addition, scuba diving should be avoided during pregnancy due to the inability of the fetal pulmonary circulation to filter bubble formation.  For more information regarding physical activity and exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period, please refer to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee Opinion Paper published in 2015, and the current edition of the American College of Sports Medicine’s Guidelines to Exercise Testing and Prescription.\nOlder Adults Physical Activity Benefits According to the American College of Sports Medicine, older adults are defined as those 65 years and older, and individuals aged 50 to 64 years with clinically significant conditions or physical limitations that affect movement.\nRegular physical activity is an essential component of healthy aging. In addition to the many health benefits gained by younger individuals, physical activity confers benefits that are particularly important for older adults.\n For example, regular physical activity:  improves psychologic and cognitive well-being prevents, delays, and helps to manage many chronic diseases reduces the incidence of falls and injuries sustained from falls facilitates independent living increases the duration and quality of life    Physical activity and exercise for older adults is especially important since this population is the least physically active of any age group.\nPhysical Activity Recommendations The key physical activity recommendations are the same for both adults and older adults:\n All older adults should avoid inactivity.  Some physical activity is better than none, and older adults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits.   For substantial health benefits, older adults should do at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.  Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes, and preferably, it should be spread throughout the week. For additional and more extensive health benefits, older adults should increase their aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity, or 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity.   Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond this amount. Older adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that are moderate or high intensity and involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits.  Exercise Considerations As noted previously, the physical activity recommendations and exercise guidelines for older adults are largely similar to those established for young and middle-aged adults; however, as with any special population group, some unique considerations do exist.\n  When older adults cannot do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week because of chronic conditions or physical limitations, they should be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow.\n  Older adults should determine their level of effort for physical activity relative to their level of fitness.\n Whereas exercise intensity for younger adults is classified in absolute terms (i.e., METs), exercise and physical activity for older adults should be defined relative to the individual’s level of fitness using a 10-point scale of perceived physical exertion, where 0 is considered sitting quietly and 10 is considered an ‘all-out' effort. Moderate-intensity corresponds to a 5 or 6 and produces noticeable increases in heart rate and respiration; vigorous-intensity corresponds to a 7 or 8 and produces large increases in heart rate and respiration.    To reduce the risk of falling and injuries from falls, older adults should perform neuromotor exercises to improve balance, coordination, and proprioception.\n  Older adults should select exercise modalities and activities that do not impose excessive orthopedic stress, such as low-impact weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing activities.\n Walking, aquatic exercise, and stationary cycling, are preferable for those with limited tolerance to weight-bearing activity.    Older adults with chronic conditions should understand whether and how their health conditions affect their ability to do regular physical activity safely.\n Those with chronic disease such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or diabetes, must consider exercise considerations specific to those conditions.    For more information regarding physical activity and exercise for older adults, please refer to chapter 5 of the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, and the current edition of the American College of Sports Medicine’s Guidelines to Exercise Testing and Prescription, and ACSM’s position stand paper regarding exercise for older adults.\nChildren \u0026 Adolescents Physical Activity Recommendations Regular physical activity among youth and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years is essential to promote health and fitness.\nAccording to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans:\n Children and adolescents should do 60 minutes or more of physical activity daily.  Most of the 60 or more minutes a day should be either moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, and should include vigorous-intensity physical activity at least 3 days a week. As part of their 60 or more minutes of daily physical activity, children and adolescents should include muscle-strengthening physical activity on at least 3 days of the week:  Unstructured play on playground equipment, climbing trees, tug-of-war, or for adolescents structured resistance training exercises, all of which provide an overload stimulus that strengthens muscles.   As part of their 60 or more minutes of daily physical activity, children and adolescents should include bone-strengthening physical activity on at least 3 days of the week.  Bone-strengthening activities produce a force on bones that promotes bone growth and strength. This force is often produced by impact with the ground while running or jumping.      It is important to encourage young people to participate in physical activities that are appropriate for their age, that are enjoyable, and that offer variety.\nExercise Considerations Generally, the exercise programming guidelines for healthy adults are applicable to children and adolescents. However, it is important to remember that children and adolescents are not simply mini adults and some programming modifications may be both needed to address the preferences and abilities of the youth population. In addition, exercise professionals should be mindful of the following considerations when working with this special population.\n  Youth must receive thorough instruction regarding proper resistance training technique, safety precautions, and appropriate program progression.\n Youth must be both mentally and physically ready to comply with instructions and to withstand the stress of an appropriately-designed exercise training program. Supervision and instruction should be provided by adults having an understanding of youth training guidelines and knowledge of the unique physical and psychosocial characteristics of youth.    Select stage appropriate activities and exercises.\n The stage of neurological and physical development will determine a child’s ability to participate in organized activities requiring complex, coordinated movements.    Due to immature thermoregulatory systems, youth should avoid prolonged vigorous exercise in hot humid environments, maintain proper hydration, and appropriately modify the intensity and duration of activity to avoid heat-related conditions such as heat exhaustion or heatstroke.\n  Focus on enjoyment and self-improvement related to physical activity and exercise.\n Create a positive experience to cultivate a life-long habit of regular physical activity.    Youth with disease or disability should have their exercise programs and physical activities modified to their condition, limitations, and level of physical fitness.\n  Discourage time spent in sedentary activities such as watching television, playing video games, and “surfing” the Internet.\n The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children limit total entertainment screen time to less than two hours per day.     Section 2: Medical Conditions Section two will review exercise programing guidelines and considerations for those with medical conditions including:\n asthma diabetes hypertension osteoporosis  Asthma Since 2001, the prevalence of asthma in the United States has increased by 1.5% annually. Asthma affected 25.7 million Americans in 2010, of which 7.0 million were children and 18.7 million were adults. Although for most the symptoms of asthma are only occasional and mild, for some, asthma can be a debilitating and potentially life-threatening disease.\nAsthma is a common pulmonary disorder characterized by chronic airway inflammation and periods of reversible airflow obstruction known as an asthma attack.\n Airflow is obstructed by inflammation which leads to contraction of the smooth muscles lining the airways (i.e., bronchi, bronchioles). This narrowing of the airways is called bronchospasm or bronchoconstriction. In addition, the cells lining the airways also overproduce mucus, contributing to further airway restriction. An asthma attack often occurs in reaction to certain exposures such as airway infections, airborne allergens such as pollen, mold spores, dust mites, animal dander, environmental factors like cold and/or dry air, and airborne irritants including chemicals, tobacco smoke, and air pollution. Common symptoms of an asthma attack:  persistent coughing wheezing dyspnea (shortness of breath) chest tightness or pain   Asthma attacks can range in severity from a nuisance to a life-threatening event.  Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm and Asthma Physical activity and exercise may also trigger bronchospasm among individuals with or without chronic asthma.\n  Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm (EIB)\n the bronchospasm occurring during or immediately after exercise for those without underlying asthma    Exercise-Induced Asthma (EIA)\n the bronchospasm occurring during or immediately after exercise among those with asthma    Common symptoms of exercise-induced bronchospasm and exercise-induced asthma (similar to other asthma attacks):\n persistent coughing wheezing chest tightness dyspnea or shortness of breath labored breathing    The bronchospasm and related symptoms typically begin within 6 to 8 minutes after the start of exercise and may peak 5 to 15 minutes after exercise has been ended.\n  Treatment medication:\n Bronchospasm induced by exercise may be controlled or prevented through the use of short-acting inhaled b-agonist medications (e.g., albuterol, levalbuterol) taken 15 minutes before exercise as directed by a physician. Those with chronic asthma are also typically treated with inhaled corticosteroids, which may play an additional role in the management of exercise-induced asthma and bronchospasm.  Although exercise may trigger an asthma attack, a recent systematic review of scientific literature indicates that higher levels of physical activity may provide protection against the development of chronic asthma.\nExercise Recommendations Similar to individuals with other chronic diseases, those individuals with poorly managed chronic asthma should consult with their physician prior to engaging in a new exercise program.\nThis section summarizes the key exercise programming recommendations for those with asthma:\n Frequency:  Aerobic-type activity should be performed at least 2 to 3 days per week, yet ideally striving toward 3 to 5 days per week.   Intensity:  The exercise intensity should be low-to-moderate based on the individual’s level of fitness and limitations. The use of the Dyspnea Scale, the Talk Test, or a rating of perceived exertion may serve as good subjective guides regarding exercise intensity. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends an intensity corresponding to 40% to 59% of heart rate reserve, progressing to 60% to 70%.   Time:  The duration of aerobic exercise should be progressively increased to a least 30 to 40 minutes per day, as tolerated.   Type:  Aerobic activities should include those utilizing the large muscle groups such as walking, cycling, or swimming, preferably in a non-chlorinated pool which is less likely to trigger an asthmatic episode. The resistance training guidelines for individuals with asthma are the same as those recommended for healthy adults.    Additional Considerations and Precautions In addition to the guidelines presented previously, it is important to also be aware of the following considerations and precautions:\n Individuals experiencing an asthmatic episode should not exercise until symptoms and airway function have improved. Use of short-acting bronchodilators, as prescribed by a physician, may be necessary before or after exercise to prevent or manage exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Rescue medication should be available during exercise for use during an asthma attack. Closely monitor asthmatic clients for early signs of an asthma attack and respond immediately by reducing exercise intensity or terminating exercise. Call for medical help if symptoms do not subside with exercise modifications and/or self-administered medication. A prolonged and gradual warm-up and cool-down period should be utilized. Limit or avoid exercise in environments that expose the individual to pollen, pollution, or cold air. Wearing a face mask during exercise in cold, dry air allows the air to be warmed and humidified to minimize onset of bronchospasm. Swimming and aquatic exercise tend to be better tolerated by asthmatic populations; however, pools with a high chlorine concentration may trigger asthmatic events.  Significant exercise modifications may not be necessary for those with mild or well-controlled asthma.\nDiabetes Diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2015, representing nearly 80,000 deaths. In addition, diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities, thus contributing to the substantial health and economic burden imposed by diabetes in the United States and worldwide.\nDiabetes Mellitus (or simply Diabetes)\n A group of metabolic diseases characterized by an elevated level of blood glucose as the result of insufficient insulin production and/or an inability to utilize insulin.  Two major types of diabetes:\n Type 1 Diabetes  previously called insulin-dependent or juvenile-onset diabetes   Type 2 Diabetes  previously called non-insulin dependent or adult-onset diabetes    Type 1 Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.\n Insulin is a hormone that facilitates the uptake of glucose into cells. When insulin production is insufficient, blood glucose levels rise causing hyperglycemia. In adults, type 1 diabetes accounts for approximately 5% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes.  Type 2 Type 2 diabetes typically begins with insulin resistance, a disorder in which the cells of the skeletal muscle, liver, and fat tissue do not use insulin properly.\n As the need for insulin rises, the beta cells in the pancreas gradually lose the ability to produce a sufficient amount of insulin. Obesity and physical inactivity each contribute to insulin resistance and are risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes. In adults, type 2 diabetes accounts for about 90% to 95% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes. Diabetes-specific complications, primarily involving small vessels, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, may lead to serious outcomes:  visual disturbances or blindness renal failure gangrene or amputation    Diabetes accelerates and exacerbates the occurrence of arteriosclerosis, increasing the risks of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.\nExercise Benefits   Regular physical activity, higher cardiorespiratory fitness, and healthy body weight are each associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes:\n increases insulin sensitivity increases glucose uptake causing lowered blood glucose levels reduces body fat improves cardiovascular function    As a result, physical activity and exercise offer enormous benefits to individuals with diabetes:\n Weight loss is the dominant predictor of lower risk for and incidence of type 2 diabetes, but increased physical activity reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes independent of weight loss. Muscular contractions during exercise and physical activity increase glucose uptake into the cells and improve insulin sensitivity.    The effects of a single bout of aerobic exercise on insulin action vary with duration, intensity, and subsequent diet, but a single session increases insulin action and glucose tolerance for 2 to 72 hours post-exercise.\n  Exercise Recommendations Safe exercise participation can be complicated by the presence of diabetes-related health issues like CVD, hypertension, neuropathy, and microvascular changes; therefore, preparticipation evaluation and clearance by a physician is recommended prior to initiation of exercise for those with diabetes.\n Frequency:  Aerobic exercise should be performed at least 3 days/week with no more than two consecutive days between bouts of exercise. Ideally, diabetic individuals should strive toward 5 to 7 days/week of aerobic physical activity and exercise.   Intensity:  Aerobic exercise should be performed at least at a moderate intensity, corresponding to approximately 40% to 60% of VO2R, 40% to 60% of HRR, or 65% to 75% of maximum heart rate. Moderate-intensity may also correspond to a RPE of 5 to 6 on the 0 to 10 point scale. Better blood glucose control may be achieved at higher intensities, so individuals should consider more vigorous exercise when appropriate.   Time:  Individuals with type 2 diabetes should engage in a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise or greater. Additional benefits such as weight loss and healthy weight management are attained by increasing weekly physical activity to 300 minutes or more.   Type:  Any form of aerobic exercise that uses large muscle groups and causes a sustainable elevation in heart rate is likely to be beneficial. Personal interests, enjoyment, and desired goals of the exercise program should be considered when selecting the ideal mode of aerobic exercise.    Since most individuals with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes are likely to be overweight or obese, a combination of increased energy expenditure and decreased energy intake should be emphasized to create a caloric deficit that supports weight loss and healthy weight maintenance.\nA combination of aerobic and resistance training may be more effective for blood glucose management than either type of exercise alone.\nThe resistance training exercise guidelines for those with diabetes are generally the same as those for apparently healthy adults.\nHypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose level \nIn diabetic individuals who use insulin, the combined effects of both exercise and insulin to increase glucose uptake can lead to hypoglycemic episodes.\n  Common Symptoms:\n shakiness weakness abnormal sweating nervousness anxiety tingling of the mouth and fingers hunger    If pre-exercise blood glucose level is less than 100 mg/dL, the American Diabetes Association recommends that carbohydrates be ingested before any physical activity or exercise, but this applies only to individuals taking insulin and are therefore more susceptible to hypoglycemia.\n Insulin users should likely consume 20 to 60 grams of carbohydrates before exercise for an initial blood glucose level of with the actual amount of carbohydrate ingestion necessary being dependent upon insulin dosage and timing, pre-exercise blood glucose, and the planned exercise duration and intensity.    It’s important to realize that hypoglycemia may be delayed and can occur up to 12 hours after exercise.\n In particular, vigorous-intensity exercise can result in substantial depletion of muscle glycogen, thereby increasing the risk for post-exercise hypoglycemia in those who use insulin. In such cases, the consumption of 5 to 30 grams of carbohydrate during and within 30 minutes after glycogen-depleting exercise will lower the risk of hypoglycemia and facilitate more efficient replenishment of muscle glycogen.    Medication dosage adjustments to prevent exercise-associated hypoglycemia may be necessary for individuals who use insulin.\n Insulin must not be injected into exercising arms or legs. Exercise sessions should be performed when insulin action is declining, for example, 2 hours after fast-acting insulin, or 3-4 hours after regular insulin injections. Individuals will need to monitor blood glucose levels before, occasionally during, and after exercise and compensate with appropriate dietary and/or medication regimen changes, particularly when exercising at insulin peak times.    Diabetic clients must be carefully educated about the effects of physical activity on their blood glucose and the appropriate modifications of diet and insulin therapy.\n  Additional Considerations and Precautions It is also note the following considerations and precautions when working with diabetic clients:\n In diabetic individuals with retinopathy or macular degeneration, activities that greatly increase intraocular pressure, such as high-intensity aerobic or resistance training and head-down positions, are not recommended, nor are jumping or jarring activities, all of which increase hemorrhage risk. All diabetic individuals (especially those with peripheral neuropathy) should closely examine their feet on a daily basis to detect sores or ulcers early and follow recommendations for use of proper footwear. Anyone with a foot injury or open sore or ulcer should be restricted to non-weight-bearing activities. Since diabetics are likely to have impaired thermoregulation, take proper precautions to avoid heat (e.g., heat exhaustion, heatstroke) and cold (hypothermia, frostbite) illnesses.  Hypertension Hypertension continues to be a major public health problem in the United States and is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease.\nBlood Pressure is the measure of the pressure, or resistance to blood flow, within the arterial vascular system\n  Expressed in mmHg (millimeters of mercury) s\n  Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)\n Represents the pressure exerted against the arterial vessel walls during a left ventricular contraction    Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)\n Represents the pressure in the arterial vascular system during the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle    Normal Blood Pressure\n Is a systolic pressure less than 120 AND a diastolic pressure less than 80    Prehypertension\n If the systolic pressure is between 120 and 139 OR the diastolic pressure is between 80 and 89 Those individuals who fall within the prehypertensive category have twice the risk of developing hypertension than those who have a normal blood pressure    Hypertension\n Is defined as a resting systolic pressure equal to or greater than 140 OR a diastolic pressure equal to or greater than 90    These classifications are based on the average of two or more properly measured blood pressure readings obtained in the seated position on two or more occasions.\nOne is also considered to be hypertensive if they take an antihypertensive medication to control their high blood pressure.\n   Classification Systolic (mmHg)  Diastolic (mmHg)     Normal And   Prehypertension 120-139 Or 80-89   Hypertension      Stage 1 Hypertension 140-159 Or 90-99   Stage 2 Hypertension ≥ 160 Or ≥ 100    Exercise Benefits Physical activity and exercise play an important role in the prevention and management of hypertension.\nPost-Exercise Hypotension\n Dynamic exercise acutely reduces blood pressure below baseline levels for several hours after an exercise session. Post-exercise hypotension is clinically significant, offering many hypertensive individuals the health benefit of having their blood pressure transiently lowered during the day when blood pressure is typically at its highest.  Epidemiological studies have shown that there is an inverse relationship between physical activity and blood pressure such that increased levels of physical activity result in blood pressure reductions.\n Regular physical activity lowers blood pressure across all populations studied, with the most significant reductions observed among hypertensive individuals. Among adults at all blood pressure levels, aerobic physical activity decreases systolic and diastolic blood pressure, on average by 2-5mmHg and 1-4mmHg, respectively. The primary mechanism contributing to the decrease in blood pressure observed with regular physical activity is a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance. Although some researchers have reported beneficial changes to systolic blood pressure as the result of resistance training, currently, the overall evidence does not provide consistent support for resistance training as an independent intervention for blood pressure reduction.  Exercise Recommendations Those diagnosed with hypertension, particularly in the presence of additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, should undergo a preparticipation evaluation and obtain written clearance from a physician prior to beginning an exercise program.\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans are applicable and appropriate for those with hypertension.\nSpecifically, adults should strive to accumulate 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity.\nSpecific recommendations with regard to frequency, intensity, time, and type for both aerobic exercise and resistance training are provided:\n Frequency:  With regard to the frequency of aerobic exercise, since a single bout of exercise can cause an acute reduction in blood pressure that lasts several hours post-exercise, those with hypertension or at risk for hypertension should exercise on most, preferably all days of the week.   Intensity:  To maximize the benefits of aerobic physical activity, while mitigating potential adverse cardiovascular responses, hypertensive clients should exercise at a moderate intensity corresponding to 40 to 60% of heart rate reserve or a rating of perceived exertion corresponding to 5 or 6 on a scale of 0 to 10.   Time:  The duration of time spent engaged in physical activity should accumulate to 30 to 60 minutes per day of continuous or intermittent activity, with an emphasis placed on aerobic activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming.   Type:  Overall, the resistance training recommendations for hypertensive individuals are similar to those for apparently healthy adults. Time spent performing resistance training exercises should supplement time dedicated to aerobic activity. Hypertensive individuals should focus on dynamic resistance training that involves both a concentric and eccentric phase of muscular action. Isometric or static resistance training exercises are generally considered to be contraindicated for those with hypertension.    Additional Considerations and Precautions In addition to the recommendation presented previously, the following considerations and precautions should also be kept in mind when designing an exercise program for those with hypertension:\n Individuals with uncontrolled severe hypertension (i.e., SBP ≥ 180mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110mmHg) should begin exercise training only after evaluation by their physician and beginning antihypertensive medication as prescribed by their doctor. Resting SBP ≥ 200mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110 is a relative contraindication to exercise. During exercise it is prudent to maintain SBP ≤ 220mmHg and/or DBP ≤ 105mmHg. Resistance training is contraindicated for individuals with unstable angina, uncontrolled hypertension (SBP ≥ 160mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 100mmHg), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, a recent history of congestive heart failure, significant heart valve disease, or pathological enlargement of the heart. Since dynamic exercise leads to acute post-exercise hypotension, clients should be reminded to rise slowly from supine and seated positions to avoid a sudden drop in blood pressure associated with a change in posture (i.e., orthostatic hypotension). Client’s should be instructed on correct breathing patterns to avoid straining or performing the Valsalva maneuver during resistance training, which could cause a potentially dangerous elevation of blood pressure. During resistance training, the individual should exhale during the concentric phase and inhale during the eccentric phase of the exercise. Since many individuals with hypertension are also overweight or obese, the exercise program should emphasize a daily caloric expenditure of more than 300 kcal, coupled with reduced caloric intake to facilitate weight loss.  By observing the recommendations and precautions presented in this section, exercise professionals can safely and effectively deliver exercise programming to individuals at risk for or diagnosed with hypertension.\nOsteoporosis Pathophysiology Skeletal tissue is comprised of a collagen matrix, which gives bone flexible properties, and mineral content (i.e., calcium and phosphates), which provides the stiffness.\n  There are two types of bones:\n Cortical (or Compact Bone)  found mainly in the long shafts of bones and accounts for about 80% of all bone tissue   Trabecular  a spongy tissue having a lattice or honeycomb structure, and is found in the vertebrae, pelvis, flat bones, and ends of long bones      Bone is a dynamic tissue with the ability to grow and self-repair. The bone matrix consists of three types of bone cells:\n Osteoclasts  bone-destroying cells that cause resorption of the bone tissue   Osteoblasts  bone-building cells that stimulate the formation of new bone tissue   Osteocytes  mature bone cells that help to regulate bone remodeling      Bone remodeling is a continuous process involving the coupled action of osteoclasts and osteoblasts:\n osteoclasts first resorb (i.e., breakdown) older bone osteoblasts subsequently form and mineralize new bone    During periods of growth and maturation, the activity of osteoblasts exceeds osteoclasts, so bones grow, increase mineral density, and gain strength. After peak bone mass is attained, typically in the mid-to-late twenties, the activity of osteoclasts gradually outpaces osteoblasts leading to loss of bone mineral density and strength. The rate of bone loss is influenced by genetics, hormonal factors, dietary habits, and other lifestyle behaviors. If the loss of bone mineral density becomes significant, it may result in osteopenia or osteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mineral density and changes in the microstructure of bone leading to increased risk of fracture.\n Osteoporosis is defined as a bone mineral density (BMD) value greater than 2.5 standard deviations below the young adult mean value.  Exercise Benefits Regular physical activity and exercise play an important role across the lifespan to reduce the risk and progression of osteoporosis.\nYouth:\n During youth and adolescence, physical activities that generate relatively high loading forces, such as running, jumping, and hopping, promote increased bone mineral density and bone mass that are maintained into adulthood. It is particularly important to encourage bone-loading activities among pre-pubescent children since there is evidence suggesting the positive impact on increased peak bone mass is more dramatic at this time and persists into adulthood.  Young- to Mid-Adults:\n In healthy young and middle adulthood, weight-bearing exercise of sufficient magnitude to overload the skeleton should be performed. It may be necessary to load the skeleton with greater than 2.5x body weight. It is unclear if exercise can increase bone mineral density in aging adults, but studies do suggest that regular physical activity can attenuate the age-related decline in bone mineral density.  Premenopausal Women:\n In premenopausal women, the findings from several meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of different modes of exercise on bone mineral density indicate that resistance training and high-impact weight-bearing exercise, alone or in combination, can produce 1% to 2% gains at the lumbar spine and femoral neck.  Post-Menopausal Women:\n In older post-menopausal women, exercise may help to preserve bone mass; however, some women may still require hormone therapy to combat significant loss of bone mineral density.  Older Adults:\n Regular physical activity reduces the incidence of falls and fragility fractures among older adults. Epidemiological evidence suggests that regular moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with a 30% to 50% lower incidence of vertebral or hip fractures in both men and women. Studies have consistently demonstrated the beneficial effects of balance-oriented activities on the risk of falls and fall-related injuries.  Exercise Recommendations The following recommendations are adopted from the American College of Sports Medicine’s position stand titled, “Physical Activity and Bone Health” as well as other published articles.\nYouth:\n For children and adolescents, the mode of exercise should include impact activities such as running, jumping, and hopping, and sports such as gymnastics, soccer, and basketball, which involve increased ground reaction forces. In children, the most effective programs to promote bone health are those that incorporate a combination of moderate- to high-impact weight-bearing activities that are multidirectional in nature and applied rapidly. The most successful exercise programs appear to be those that incorporate a wide variety of weight-bearing impact activities ranging in magnitude from 3 to 9 times body weight. In addition, age-appropriate moderate-intensity resistance training is recommended; however, for safety reasons, the intensity should be Bone-strengthening activities should be performed at least 3 days per week for 10 to 20 minutes per session and studies suggest that multiple shorter bouts of bone-loading exercise per day are more effective than a single longer bout.  Adults:\n For adults, weight-bearing endurance activities such as walking, jogging, or stair climbing, and activities that involve jumping such as volleyball or basketball should be performed 3 to 5 times per week. In addition, adults should engage in regular resistance training performed 2 to 3 days per week at a moderate- to high-intensity corresponding to 5 to 15 repetitions per set. For both overall and bone health, adults should strive toward 30 to 60 minutes of activity per day. Dynamic, multidirectional activities rather than static exercises should be favored in the exercise program.      Children \u0026 Adolescents Adults     Mode Impact activities (e.g., running, jumping, hopping), sports that involve running and jumping (e.g., soccer, basketball, gymnastics), and moderate intensity resistance training Weight-bearing endurance activities (e.g., walking, jogging, stair climbing), activities that involve jumping (e.g., volleyball, basketball), and resistance training   Intensity High, in terms of bone-loading forces; for safety reasons resistance training should be Moderate to high in terms of bone-loading forces   Frequency At least 3 days per week Weight-bearing endurance activities 3-5 times per week, resistance training 2-3 times per week   Duration 10 to 20 minutes per session (2 times per day or more may be more effective) 30 to 60 minutes per day of a combination of weight-bearing endurance activities, activities that involve jumping, and resistance training    Precautions It is important to also be aware of some precautions when working with individuals at risk for or having osteoporosis:\n Individuals with indications or confirmed diagnosis of osteoporosis should consult with a physician before beginning a resistance training program or impact activities. High-risk populations should consult with their physician regarding the need for a bone density test.  High-risk populations: post-menopausal women, older adults, individuals of Caucasian or Asian descent, those with a family history of osteoporosis, small body frame, low calcium intake, history of eating disorders, receiving treatment for cancer in the past or at the present time, and women with indications of the female athlete triad such as amenorrhea and low energy intake.   Clients diagnosed with osteoporosis, with or without history of vertebral fracture, should not engage in jumping activities, explosive movements, high-impact loading, activities that cause twisting, deep forward flexion, or compression of the spine. High-impact jumping  2.5x body weight and other plyometric exercises should be avoided in postmenopausal women and older men if bone status is unknown.   Section 3: Injuries \u0026 Emergency Response Section three of this module reviews immediate care for common exercise-related musculoskeletal injuries and emergency response to heat-related disorders and adverse cardiovascular events.\nMusculoskeletal Injuries Exercise participants may suffer from a wide variety of exercise-related musculoskeletal injuries:\n  Acute Injury\n Occurs as a single and instantaneous incident of physical trauma to the body Although often preventable, acute injuries are typically unpredictable and accidental in nature Strains, sprains, and fractures are common accute injuries Strain  Occurs when muscle fibers and/or a tendon partially tears as the result of a forceful contraction or overstretching More severe musculotendinous injuries involve complete full-thickness tears Signs and symptoms of a mild strain may be minor such as slight swelling and discomfort, yet ranging to more significant symptoms such as increased swelling, hemorrhage, pain, tissue deformity, strength deficits, and loss of function in the case of partial or full-thickness tears   Sprain  An acute injury that damages a ligament Sprains often occur when a joint undergoes a forceful or sudden motion that exceeds the joint’s normal range of motion such as hyperextension, hyperflexion, or twisting. A ligament sprain is characterized by pain, swelling, discoloration, joint instability, and loss of range of motion In more severe cases, there may also be dislocation or deformity of the affected joint   Fracture  is a partial or complete break of a bone      Chronic Injury\n Develops more gradually and is not typically associated with a single incident Chronic injuries occur in response to overuse, repetitive motions, inappropriate exercise technique, insufficient rest, poor body mechanics and postural alignment, or improper use of equipment Symptoms of a chronic injury typically have a more gradual onset and are often associated with inflammation of soft tissue and pain The suffix '-iitis' indicates inflammation as seen in the overuse injuries tendonitis, bursitis, and plantar fasciitis Bones may also be subject to overuse injuries such as a stress fracture    Care Exercise and physical activity present a small yet inherent risk of injury. Therefore, it is important to be prepared to respond appropriately and provide immediate care for exercise-related injuries.\nThe recommended immediate care for most exercise-related injuries includes PRICE: Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation\n Protection  Necessary to avoid further injury and undue stress to the injured site, which may delay the healing and recovery process Protection may include application of a bandage, wrap, splint, or sling, and in the case of lower body injuries, the use of crunches to minimize weight bearing   Rest  Restricted activity is required to reduce the metabolic demands of the injured tissue and to avoid increased blood flow to the injured site Rest may permit some general activity, but the client must avoid any activity that induces stress to the injured area and thus can compromise the healing process   Ice  Used to limit the injury-induced damage by reducing the temperature of the injured tissues and consequently reducing metabolic demand, inducing vasoconstriction, and limiting the bleeding, all of which help to control swelling Ice can also provide an analgesic effect by increasing threshold levels in the free nerve endings and by increasing nerve conduction latency, which reduces the sensation of pain Ice should be applied in intervals lasting approximately 20 minutes separated by 60 minutes uncovered before reapplication   Compression is applied to stop hemorrhage and reduce swelling  Compression bandages should be applied distally and wrapped proximally Compression should be applied to reduce swelling, but to otherwise permit normal blood circulation   Elevation  Elevation of the injured site above the level of the heart lowers the pressure in local blood vessels and helps to limit the bleeding Elevation also increases drainage through the lymph vessels to further reduce swelling    Heat-Related Disorders Heat-related disorders include exertional heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and exertional heatstroke. Environmental factors, such as high ambient air temperature, high relative humidity, low wind speed, and solar radiant heat contribute to excessive fluid loss (i.e., dehydration) and elevate core body temperature (i.e., hyperthermia) may lead to the development of heat-related disorders.\nHeat Cramps\n Painful involuntary muscle spasms, often affecting the lower extremities and abdomen, that may occur during or after prolonged strenuous exercise in the heat Immediate care for exertional heat cramps:  rest static stretching of the affected muscle groups consumption of fluids and foods containing table salt    Heat Exhaustion\n  Signs and symptoms:\n low blood pressure elevated heart rate and respiratory rate profuse sweating slightly elevated core body temperature headache weakness nausea irritability decreased muscle coordination skin appears ashen or pale, clammy, and often with “goose bumps”    An individual suspected of suffering from heat exhaustion should be moved into a shaded or air conditioned area, excess clothing should be removed, and fluids (e.g., water and/or sports drink) should be consumed if the individual is able to swallow and is not vomiting.\n  The individual should lay in a supine position with the legs elevated and monitored closely during recovery.\n  Most individuals will respond favorably to prompt care; however, if symptoms do not improve or worsen, the individual should receive advanced emergency treatment from the appropriate personnel.\n  Exertional Heatstroke\n A life-threatening medical emergency Heatstroke is defined as hyperthermia (i.e., core body temperature  104˚ F), central nervous system dysfunction, and multiple organ system failure. It is often difficult to discern severe heat exhaustion from heatstroke as many of the signs and symptoms are similar. Although the skin may initially appear sweaty and pale, classic heatstroke is characterized by hot, dry, and red skin. Symptoms of exertional heatstroke related to central nervous system dysfunction:  dizziness confusion disorientation irrational behavior impaired balance and coordination seizures loss of consciousness coma   In addition, victims of heatstroke are likely to be severely dehydrated and may have symptoms such as:  tachycardia (i.e., heart rate 100 beats/min) hyperventilation low blood pressure vomiting diarrhea   When exertional heatstroke is suspected, the emergency medical system should be activated immediately by calling 911. Successful treatment and survival from heatstroke requires immediate, whole-body cooling using cold water or ice water immersion. If whole-body immersion is not possible, then ice water towels should be applied on the head, torso, and extremities and ice packs applied to the neck, axillary region, and groin.     Heat-Related Disorders Signs \u0026 Symptoms Immediate Care     Heat Cramps Painful involuntary muscle spasms Rest, static stretching of the affected muscle groups, and consumption of fluids and foods containing table salt   Heat Exhaustion Low blood pressure, elevated heart rate and respiratory rate, profuse sweating, slightly elevated core body temperature, headache, weakness, nausea, irritability, decreased muscle coordination, and skin appears ashen or pale, clammy, and often with ‘goose bumps.’ Move to a shaded or air conditioned area, remove excess clothing, and consume fluids such as water and/or sports drink   Heatstroke Core body temperature  104˚ F; hot, dry, and red skin; CNS dysfunction (e.g., dizziness, confusion, disorientation, irrational behavior, impaired balance and coordination, seizures, loss of consciousness, and coma); multiple organ system failure; tachycardia; hyperventilation; low blood pressure; vomiting; and diarrhea Call 911, whole-body cooling using cold water, ice water immersion, or ice towels applied on the head, torso, and extremities and ice packs applied to the neck, axillary region, and groin    Prevention Strategies In order to prevent the possible onset of serious heat-related disorders, the following strategies should be implemented:\n Schedule activity during the cooler times of day or within a climate controlled environment Allow a minimum of 10 to 14 days for acclimatization to hot and humid environments Gradually increase exercise intensity and duration during the period of acclimatization Monitor the environment for conditions that may increase the incidence of heat-related disorders Conduct a preparticipation screening to identify those with a history of heat-related disorders Monitor all individuals during exercise for signs and symptoms of heat stress Educate participants regarding proper fluid intake Ensure adequate fluids are available during activity Enforce fluid intake recommendations Monitor pre- and post-activity body weight to ensure adequate hydration and rehydration Reduce exercise intensity and duration in high risk environmental conditions Plan for frequent breaks and rest periods Dress appropriately for the weather conditions Wear light weight, light colored, moisture-wicking clothing Avoid clothing, materials, and equipment that create a vapor barrier inhibiting the evaporative cooling effect of sweat  Heart Attack Although it is well-established that regular physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, strenuous physical exertion may trigger a heart attack (i.e., myocardial infarction), especially among those who do not exercise regularly. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of a heart attack and prepare to provide emergency care during these adverse events.\nWarning Signs Recognizing the symptoms of a heart attack, prompt emergency care, and advanced life support is critical for survival.\nAlthough sometimes the onset of symptoms may be very sudden and intense, oftentimes heart attacks start slowly with only mild symptoms and discomforts.\nIf a client appears to be having a heart attack, then call 911 immediately.\n The warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack may include:  prolonged or intermittent squeezing pressure or pain in the chest, which may spread to the arms, shoulders, jaw, upper back, or upper abdomen shortness of breath or difficulty breathing feelings of restlessness, apprehension, dizziness, or extreme weakness nausea or vomiting loss of consciousness cold or clammy skin bluish or ashen skin tone absence of a pulse and dilated pupils    Immediate Care The immediate care provided to a victim of a heart attack is critical to the outcome and survival from this adverse event.\nThe American Red Cross has outlined four steps in the “Cardiac Chain of Survival”\nThese four steps include:\n Early recognition of an adverse cardiovascular event and early activation of the emergency medical system (EMS) by calling 9-1-1 Early administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), a life support method using both chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth ventilation  CPR helps to supply oxygen to the brain and other vital organs until advanced care arrives   Early use of an automated external defibrillator (AED)  An AED delivers a small electrical shock to the heart that may be effective to restore normal heart rhythm   Early arrival of advanced medical care  Trained EMS professionals are able to provide more advanced care and transportation of the victim to local emergency facilities.    C-A-B In 2010, the American Heart Association changed the sequence of basic life support steps from A-B-C (airway, breathing, circulation) to C-A-B (chest compressions, airway, breathing).\n When providing immediate care for a victim suspected of having a heart attack, first check for a pulse. If there is no pulse, begin chest compressions  Chest compressions help circulate the oxygen-rich blood throughout the body   After a series of chest compressions, open the victim’s airway and check for signs of breathing  Look to see if the chest rises and falls Listen near the mouth for breath sounds Feel for air passing through the nose and mouth   If the signs of breathing are absent, then begin rescue breathing  The purpose of rescue breathing is to supply oxygen via the cardiorespiratory system to the brain and vital organs    Summary:\n Check for a pulse Chest compressions: if no pulse, then begin chest compressions immediately Airway: open victim’s airway and check for signs of breathing Breathing: if no signs of breathing, then begin rescue breathing  NETA -Certified Personal Trainers must hold and maintain an acceptable CPR and AED certification, which must include a live hands-on practical skills evaluation.\nStroke A stroke is a condition that affects the arteries supplying oxygen-rich blood to and within the brain.\nA stroke occurs when an artery supplying the brain is either:\n blocked, known as an ischemic stroke ruptures, known as a hemorrhagic stroke  In either case, the part of the brain supplied by the affected artery cannot receive the vital oxygen and nutrients needed to survive, resulting in death of brain cells.\n The outcome of a stroke may include:  paralysis physical disabilities visual or speech impairments memory loss altered cognition even death    FAST An individual suspected of having a stroke requires immediate medical attention.\nEarly recognition and prompt activation of the emergency medical system is critical.\nThe American Stroke Association has developed an acronym, FAST, to help identify a stroke:\n Face Drooping: Does one side of the face droop or is it numb?  Ask the person to smile. Is the person’s smile uneven or lopsided?   Arm Weakness: Is one arm weak or numb?  Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?   Speech Difficulty: Is speech slurred? Is the person unable to speak or hard to understand?  Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence, like “The sky is blue.” Is the person able to correctly repeat the words?   Time to call 911: If someone shows any of these symptoms, even if the symptoms go away, call 9-1-1 and say, “I think this is a stroke” to help get the person to the hospital immediately.  Time is important! Don’t delay, and also note the time when the first symptoms appeared. Emergency responders will want to know.     Section 4: Legal Considerations Legal considerations represent an important matter for exercise professionals who deliver services such as fitness assessments, exercise instruction, and individualized exercise programming for their clients.\nThis section will review:\n basic legal concepts common liability exposures strategies to minimize risk for exercise professionals and their clients  Important Disclaimer: The information presented in this section is offered only for general educational purposes and should NOT be considered legal advice or a substitute for appropriate legal consultation. Do not act or rely on any information contained in this module without first seeking the advice of a qualified attorney.\nStandards of Care \u0026 Negligence Negligence Negligence is failing to act according to a generally accepted standard, or as a reasonable and prudent person would under the same or similar circumstances.\n A negligent act can occur if a fitness professional:  fails to act (i.e., act of omission) or acts inappropriately (i.e., act of commission)   For example, if a personal trainer does not administer appropriate preparticipation screening prior to training a new client, this may be viewed as a negligent act of omission. If a personal trainer instructed a client with known shoulder impingement syndrome to perform the behind-the-head lat pulldown exercise, this may be viewed as a negligent act of commission.  Standards of Care In the case of Personal Trainers, a reasonable and prudent person is someone who adheres to the established standards of care.\nStandards of Care (also known as Standards of Practice) indicate the manner in which services should be delivered to provide reasonable assurance that the desired outcomes will be attained and ensuring the safety of the client.\n Standards of care are represented by the various standards, guidelines, and recommendations published by professional organizations within the fitness industry such as ACSM, AHA, NSCA, and the Medical Fitness Association. When an exercise professional accepts responsibility for providing a service, their performance is measured against the standard of care of a qualified professional in that situation. Since attorneys, judges, and jurors cannot be expected to know the standards of care for various professions, expert witnesses are hired to educate the court and testify regarding the accepted and recognized standards.  The standards may evolve over time, so it’s important that exercise professionals stay well-informed of developments and changes to the standards of care in their profession.\nElements of Negligence In a negligence lawsuit, the burden of proof falls on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant acted negligently.\nThere are four elements that must be demonstrated in order to establish negligence in the court of law.\n Duty - Did the defendant owe a legal duty to the plaintiff?  The legal duty is an obligation or responsibility to provide services in a safe manner, to comply with accepted standards of care, and to protect the client from foreseeable injury. The nature of the special relationship or agreement between the exercise professional and the client establishes a legal duty.   Breach of Duty - Did the defendant breach the legal duty owed to the plaintiff?  In other words, did the action or inaction of the exercise professional violate the accepted standards of care, or was their conduct inconsistent with that of a reasonable and prudent person?   Damages - Did the plaintiff suffer damages or losses due to the breach of duty?  It must be demonstrated that the client suffered damages as the result of the exercise professional’s negligent action or inaction. Damages may be the specific injuries sustained and related pain and suffering, as well as economic damages such as medical expenses, lost wages, and loss of consortium.   Causation - Did the breach of duty cause the harm or injury to the plaintiff?  The exercise professional’s breach of duty must be demonstrated to be the direct or proximate cause of the harm or injury to the client. If the exercise professional had not breached their duty, then the accident and subsequent injury to the client would not have occurred. In other words, if the exercise professional had acted appropriately, the client would not have been injured.    Risk Management Risk Management is a proactive operational plan intended to minimize liability exposures, litigation, and losses for exercise professionals and the organizations they represent.\n Step One  Identify and assess existing and potential liability exposures. A liability exposure is any situation that creates the probability of harm, injury, medical emergency, or increased severity of medical emergencies. Liability exposures are created when exercise professionals fail to adhere to published standards that have been established in the fitness industry. The standards of care indicate the manner in which services should be delivered to provide reasonable assurance that the desired outcomes will be attained and ensuring the safety of the client. Standards of care are represented by the various standards, guidelines, and recommendations published by professional organizations within the fitness industry such as ACSM, AHA, NSCA, and/or the Medical Fitness Association.   Step Two  Develop strategies to minimize or, if possible, eliminate the liability exposures. This often includes the development of appropriate policies and procedures.   Step Three  Once developed, the next step is to put these strategies into practice through implementation.   Step Four  The final step is the ongoing evaluation of the risk management plan to ensure compliance to the established policies and procedures, and effectiveness to minimize risk.    There are many potential liability exposures for exercise professionals and fitness facilities. Awareness of exposures and appropriate actions to address these concerns may mitigate potential litigation and strengthen the defense against lawsuits.\nLiability Exposures Preparticipation Screening The first liability exposure is failure to conduct proper preparticipation screening and, when indicated, referral for medical evaluation and clearance.\nExercise professionals must conduct appropriate preparticipation screening for their clients prior to starting an exercise program.\nThe purpose of preparticipation health screening is to identify individuals who may be at elevated risk for exercise-related cardiovascular events, such as sudden cardiac death and/or acute myocardial infarction, or other complications during exercise.\n For most people, the risk of adverse cardiovascular events during exercise is very low, and the benefits of regular physical activity far outweigh this risk. However, the accumulating body of scientific evidence demonstrates an elevated risk of adverse cardiovascular events during and immediately following vigorous-intensity physical activity, especially among sedentary individuals who engage in unaccustomed exercise.  Preparticipation screening may be conducted using general screening tools, such as the widely-recognized Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q), or specific screening tools such as Health History Questionnaires and/or Health Risk Appraisals.\n The American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association have previously recommended pre-activity screening guidelines to identify those in need of medical evaluation and clearance based on risk classification as low-, moderate-, or high-risk. These guidelines considered the presence of known cardiovascular, metabolic, or pulmonary disease, signs or symptoms suggestive of disease, and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. In November 2015, the ACSM released updated recommendations for preparticipation screening. The new ACSM exercise preparticipation health screening process is now based on:  the individual’s current level of physical activity the presence of signs or symptoms and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease, and the desired exercise intensity to be implemented in the individual’s exercise program   These three factors have been identified as important risk modulators of exercise-related cardiovascular events. The new recommendations are intended to provide prudent screening while minimizing barriers to adopting physical activity. However, these updated recommendations should not replace sound judgment; and decisions regarding referral to a health care provider for medical clearance should continue to be made on an individual basis.  Health/Fitness Assessments Another potential liability exposure for exercise professionals is failure to conduct appropriate assessment of participant’s fitness to determine indications and contraindications for exercise programming.\nAppropriately selected fitness assessments provide valuable information used to guide individualized program design and provide the basis for sound decision making with regard to the selection of exercises and acute training variables such as exercise intensity.\n In conjunction with preparticipation screening procedures, exercise professionals should conduct health screening such as resting blood pressure, resting heart rate, and body mass index, which provide insight into the client’s current state of health and risk for chronic disease. In addition, the exercise professional should select and administer appropriate fitness assessments to evaluate the client’s cardiorespiratory capacity, muscular fitness, flexibility, dynamic posture, and body composition. Of course, fitness assessments must be performed according to standardized procedures and protocols, always observing both absolute and relative contraindications, as necessary.  The objective data and subjective observations arising from the health screening and fitness assessment protocols should be used to determine safe and appropriate initial exercise programming for the client.\nExercise Intensity Another very preventable liability exposure is failure to “prescribe” an appropriate exercise intensity (i.e. unnecessarily high intensity) in terms of metabolic, muscular, and cardiovascular demand.\n Not only is high-intensity exercise unnecessary for many individuals who want to improve their health and fitness, but high-intensity training may also increase the probability of injury and adverse cardiovascular events. Many clients will rely on and place trust in the expertise and good judgement of their personal trainers to advise them on safe and effective exercise intensity, as well as choice of exercise. It is imperative that exercise professionals consider the client’s current health status, level of fitness, physical limitations, and personal goals to determine safe and appropriate exercises and intensity for their program. Exercise professionals should be familiar with and follow accepted exercise guidelines, such as those established by the American College of Sports Medicine. Previously sedentary individuals should always begin with low-to-moderate-intensity activities, and progress gradually as they adapt and become accustomed to regular exercise. Exercise professionals must be mindful of the client’s level of exertion and respond appropriately to signs of overexertion and the client’s feedback.  Supervision \u0026 Instruction Failure to adequately or competently supervise and/or instruct clients regarding the safe performance of recommended exercises and proper use of exercise equipment can lead to injury and creates a major liability exposure.\n Exercise professionals have a duty to provide appropriate supervision and instruction to the client’s they serve. Certainly, when a client is paying for individualized programming, a personal trainer must carefully instruct and continually supervise the client to ensure he or she performs each exercise in a correct and safe manner. When working with a client or participant, the exercise professional must always be present, both physically and mentally; must be prudent, careful, and prepared; and must be aware to recognize and address potential safety concerns. This vigilance extends beyond the specific exercises to also include awareness of the environmental surroundings and the actions of other individuals within the area.  Scope of Practice Providing services or making statements outside the scope of practice for an exercise professional creates another source of potential liability and litigation.\nScope of Practice defines the specific boundaries within which an individual (i.e., exercise professional) may perform the tasks associated with their profession.\n Exercise professionals who cross the line into the scope of licensed health professionals may face both criminal charges, like practicing dietetics or medicine without a license, and civil claims of negligence.  Exercise professionals must know and abide by the scope of practice limitations based on their education, credentials, knowledge, and skill.\nRecommendations Exercise professionals should adhere to the following recommendations to ensure they stay within their recognized scope of practice:\n  Do not diagnose illness, chronic disease, medical conditions, or injuries.\n Do not make statements or offer opinions that may be misinterpreted as a diagnosis or medical advice.    Do not attempt to rehabilitate or treat injuries, diseases, or medical conditions.\n Exercise professionals do not ‘prescribe' corrective or therapeutic exercises, but they do design exercise programs intended to improve overall health and/or one or more components of physical fitness. The assessment of muscle imbalances, compensations, movement impairments, and other orthopedic issues, and the attempt to correct these issues using specific exercise interventions, is the job of a physical therapist and/or orthopedic specialist, not of the personal trainer.    Do not counsel individuals with psychological disorders.\n Exercise professionals can and should use coaching skills to facilitate lifestyle behavior change, but should never attempt to counsel or treat individuals with known or suspected mental illness.    Do not provide hands-on manipulation of soft tissue, such as massage or myofascial release, or perform musculoskeletal adjustments, such as “cracking” an individual’s spine to realign vertebrae or relieve stiffness.\n Certainly, exercise professionals may instruct clients on self-myofascial release techniques using foam rollers and other tools, but the client should always apply these techniques to themselves.    Do not misrepresent health screening protocols or fitness assessments as a medical evaluation.\n The purpose of a health history questionnaire, health risk appraisal, health screening measurements, and fitness assessments is, in part, to identify those who may require medical evaluation and clearance by a qualified health care provider before beginning an exercise program.    Do not make recommendations for an individual to alter their treatment plan, including medications, prescribed by a physician or other licensed health care provider.\n  When indicated, refer clients and participants to the appropriate health care provider for medical evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment.\n  Nutrition In addition, exercise professionals should adhere to the following recommendations specific to nutrition scope of practice:\n  Do not perform nutritional assessments to determine specific nutrient needs, excesses, deficiencies, or to recommend appropriate nutritional intake.\n  Do not design or prescribe specific meal plans or diets.\n  Do not provide or prescribe dietary recommendations intended to treat or manage illness, chronic disease, or other special medical considerations.\n  Do not recommend, encourage, provide, or sell dietary supplements or other ergogenic aids.\n  Do not promote or misrepresent yourself as a “dietitian”, “registered dietitian”, “nutritionist”, “certified nutritionist”, “nutrition specialist”, or any other occupational title using the word “dietitian” or “nutritionist”.\n In most states, the use of these titles is protected by law, restricting the use to only those licensed to practice dietetics.    Non-licensed professionals, such as personal trainers and other exercise professionals, can provide only “general non-medical” nutrition information and guidance.\n For example, non-medical nutrition information may include:  providing information about food-guidance systems such as MyPlate and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans sharing examples of healthy versus unhealthy food choices and snacks educating clients about carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water as essential nutrients needed for health educating clients and providing statistical information about the relationship between chronic disease and the excess or deficiencies of certain nutrients providing information about nutrients contained in foods or supplements and guiding clients to interpret Nutrition Facts labels      Documentation Failure to maintain appropriate documentation and records creates an unnecessary liability exposure and presents a challenge when trying to defend a lawsuit.\nExercise professionals must maintain appropriate documentation including:\n Informed Consent (completed and signed by the client) Liability Waiver (also completed and signed by the client) Preparticipation Screening Forms  Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire Health \u0026 Lifestyle Questionnaire Health Risk Appraisal   Medical Clearance to Participate (if necessary) Health/Fitness Assessment Data Exercise Training Logs  detailed record of activities and exercises performed acute training variables such as intensity, duration, workload, repetitions, tempo, etc.   Progress Notes in SOAP Format Communications with the Client’s Physician or Other Health Care Providers  All personally identifiable information and documentation, whether in paper or electronic format, maintained in conjunction with the delivery of fitness services must be treated as highly confidential and must be stored securely, such as a locked file cabinet or password-protected database.\nExercise professionals who interact with health care providers and other “covered entitie:', and who obtain client’s medical records in conjunction with the delivery of fitness services may be subject to compliance with HIPAA regulations. In these cases, exercise professionals should be familiar with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n Informed Consent Exercise professionals and personal trainers have an important responsibility, both ethically and legally, to obtain an individual’s informed consent prior to participation in a supervised exercise program.\nInformed Consent is used to communicate important information to the participant prior to exercise testing or training.\n The exact language contained within the Informed Consent document may vary based on the exercise setting and the type of assessments and/or exercise program being conducted. However, the exercise professional must ensure that the participant clearly understands the inherent risks and potential discomforts associated with the planned fitness assessments and activities.  When developing an Informed Consent, the following information must be included:\n Provide an explanation of what the client will be performing as part of the exercise testing and/or training program, and the purpose or objective of the various assessments and program components. Explain the inherent risks and potential discomforts associated with exercise.  For example, inherent risks may include:  muscle or joint injuries abnormal blood pressure response lightheadedness or fainting irregular heart rhythm in rare instances, heart attack, stroke or death   Potential discomforts may include exertional shortness of breath and muscle fatigue and/or soreness. For most people, the benefits of exercise and regular physical activity far outweigh the potential risks. Well-documented health and fitness benefits obtained from participation in a regular exercise program should be highlighted.   The participant must be aware of the importance of disclosing all relevant information regarding their current health status and past health history. Participants must promptly report any unusual feelings or symptoms they experience during exercise. Include a statement regarding confidentiality of personal and health information provided in conjunction with their exercise participation. The participant should be given the opportunity and encouraged to ask any questions they may have regarding the exercise testing or training program. Include a statement indicating that the client is voluntarily participating and is free to stop at any time. The client also acknowledges that they understand the inherent risks and are willingly consenting to participate.  The Informed Consent should be administered properly to ensure the client has sufficient time to read the document and ask questions.\nThe Informed Consent should be communicated both verbally and in writing to ensure the client understands the inherent risks and other important considerations pertaining to their participation in the exercise testing and training program.\nIt is important to consult with a lawyer who is experienced with protective documents of this nature to ensure the Informed Consent is properly written and reflective of the law in your state.\n Waiver \u0026 Release of Liability Waiver and Release of Liability is a document in which the participant knowingly releases the exercise professional and/or facility from responsibility and agrees to give up their rights to seek legal recourse and damages in the event of an injury sustained in conjunction with fitness programming.\n Waivers and releases are generally recognized in most states for the release of ordinary negligence, but not for extreme forms of negligence such as gross negligence, reckless behavior, willful and wanton misconduct, and criminal acts. The effectiveness of waivers has been debated. A signed waiver and release of liability form may or may not be upheld in a court of law. However, it is still prudent to have participants sign a liability waiver form. Since not all states uphold waiver forms, and laws regarding waivers vary from state to state, it is recommended to seek the advice of an attorney to construct a legally-defensible waiver form.   Progress Notes (SOAP) Fitness professionals should document pertinent information related to training sessions with their clients. Progress notes allow the personal trainer:\n A method to maintain a written record of the activities performed during a training session and the client’s response to these activities Provide a written record of any unusual events, outcomes, or problems associated with the exercise program or that may have been reported from outside of supervised training sessions Demonstrate professionalism, compliance with standards of care, and may provide important documentation in defense of lawsuits  A recognized approach to maintaining such documentation is known as SOAP:\n Subjective  The first component of a SOAP note contains subjective information, which includes any pertinent information, verbal or written, that is provided to the fitness professional by the participant.   Objective  The second section of the SOAP note represents objective information that may include measurements obtained, exercises performed, or data collected with regard to the exercises and activities completed during the session.   Assessment  The next section of the SOAP note is the assessment (not to be confused with a fitness assessment) but rather this assessment represents the fitness professional’s interpretations and observations of the client’s performance, tolerance, progress, and outcomes.   Plan  The final component of the SOAP note is the plan. The plan represents statements looking forward such as expected outcomes, program progression or modification, new activities, and participant “homework” assignments.     Certifications Currently, the credentialing and certification of personal trainers is not regulated in the United States. Although many employers do require their personal trainers to hold a nationally-recognized certification, professional certification of personal trainers remains a voluntary process. However, obtaining and maintaining appropriate certifications is an industry standard established by recommendations from leading organizations such as the International Health, Racquet, and Sportsclub Association, the American College of Sports Medicine, and the Medical Fitness Association.\nTherefore, failure to obtain or maintain appropriate credentials, such as professional certification and safety certifications, creates a significant liability exposure for exercise professionals and fitness facilities who employ them.\n In 2005, IHRSA’s Board of Directors released the following recommendation for the association’s member clubs:  Whereas, given the increasing importance of personal training in health, fitness and sports clubs, IHRSA recommends that as of January 1, 2006, member clubs hire personal trainers holding at least one current certification from a certifying organization/agency that has begun third-party accreditation of its certification procedures and protocols from an independent, experienced, and nationally recognized accrediting body.\n   When the recommendation was first issued, IHRSA’s Board identified the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) as being an acceptable accrediting organization. Since then, the Board has also recognized the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (formerly known as the Distance Education Training Council) as an accrediting organization of education institutions. Many fitness organizations, including NETA, sought and earned the well-recognized and respected accreditation granted by the NCCA. Organizations that chose to pursue NCCA-accreditation for their certification programs recognized that it serves as the standard for many allied health professions such as registered dietitians, athletic trainers, nurse practitioners, occupational therapists, and an NCCA-accredited certification often serves as the requisite credential in professions regulated by individual states.\nAll NCCA-accredited personal training certifications require the completion of continuing education in order to maintain the credential.\nTherefore, personal trainers must engage in relevant continuing education and follow recertification procedures set forth by their certification provider in order to maintain their certification in good standing.\nIn addition, to comply with recognized industry standards, personal trainers must obtain and maintain appropriate safety certifications including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillation (AED).\n In fact, most accredited personal training certifications require these safety certifications as a prerequisite.  Exercise professionals must take responsibility to keep all certifications in good standing and employers must perform their due diligence to verify that their staff hold appropriate credentials.\n Emergency Response Exercise professionals must hold appropriate safety certifications including CPR and AED. It is also highly recommended that exercise professionals hold certification in basic first aid.\nActing in their professional role, exercise professionals also have a duty to respond to life-threatening emergencies and provide appropriate care within the scope of their training. Failure to provide emergency aid or response may lead to litigation.\nThe American College of Sports Medicine has developed industry standards of care that call for health and fitness facilities:\n to have a written emergency plan to conduct regular emergency drills and cardiopulmonary resuscitation practice to employ personnel trained for handling emergencies to have automatic external defibrillators available for immediate use by trained personnel  As stated in the ACSM and AHA joint position paper:\n “The AHA, the IHRSA, and the ACSM recommend that all health/fitness facilities have written emergency policies and procedures that are reviewed and practiced regularly. It is essential to acknowledge that emergency equipment alone does not save lives: training and preparedness by astute professional staff who can readily handle emergencies is paramount.”\n  Liability Insurance Despite a thoughtful and well-executed risk management plan, lawsuits against exercise professionals are still an unfortunate reality. Therefore, it is important to have professional liability insurance.\nNETA has teamed with FitnessPak to provide an insurance program that is tailored to the needs of fitness professionals, providing coverage for both professional liability and general liability exposures. With three different limits options, along with 1 or 2 year terms, there’s an option to fit almost everyone’s needs.\nCheck out FitnessPak to learn more about liability insurance and coverage options.\n",

<p>Section one will review exercise programing considerations and guidelines for special populations including women during pregnancy and the postpartum period, older adults, and youth and adolescents.</p>
<h2 id="pregnancy">Pregnancy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pregnancy">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="physical-activity--exercise">Physical Activity &amp; Exercise<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#physical-activity--exercise">#</a></h3>
<p>Women with uncomplicated pregnancies should be encouraged to engage in aerobic and strength-oriented exercises before, during, and after pregnancy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular physical activity during pregnancy improves or maintains physical fitness, helps with weight management, reduces the risk of gestational diabetes in obese women, and enhances psychologic well-being.</li>
<li>According to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, <strong>healthy women who are not already highly active or doing vigorous-intensity activity should get <em>at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week</em> during pregnancy and the postpartum period</strong>.</li>
<li>In addition, pregnant women who habitually engage in vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or are highly active can continue physical activity during pregnancy and the postpartum period, provided that they remain healthy and discuss with their health care provider how and when activity should be adjusted over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exercise-contraindications--warning-signs">Exercise Contraindications &amp; Warning Signs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-contraindications--warning-signs">#</a></h3>
<p>Physical activity during uncomplicated pregnancy is both safe and desirable. Healthy women should be encouraged to exercise throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period. However, in some cases exercise may be unsafe during pregnancy. Women should consult with their health care provider throughout pregnancy to determine the appropriateness of exercise or the need for exercise modification.</p>
<p><em>Relative contraindications are those that present some risk, which must be weighed against the benefits of physical activity to determine if exercise may be appropriate.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relative contraindications for exercise during pregnancy include:</strong>
<ul>
<li>anemia</li>
<li>unevaluated maternal cardiac arrhythmia</li>
<li>chronic bronchitis</li>
<li>poorly controlled type 1 diabetes</li>
<li>extreme morbid obesity</li>
<li>extreme underweight (i.e., BMI &lt; 12)</li>
<li>history of extremely sedentary lifestyle</li>
<li>intrauterine growth restriction in current pregnancy</li>
<li>poorly controlled hypertension</li>
<li>seizure disorder</li>
<li>hyperthyroidism</li>
<li>orthopedic limitations</li>
<li>heavy smoking</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Absolute contraindications are those conditions that make exercise inappropriate or require exercise to be terminated during pregnancy.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Absolute contraindications for exercise during pregnancy include:</strong>
<ul>
<li>hemodynamically significant heart disease</li>
<li>restrictive lung disease</li>
<li>incompetent cervix or cerclage</li>
<li>multiple gestation at risk of premature labor</li>
<li>persistent second- or third-trimester bleeding</li>
<li>placenta previa after 26 weeks of gestation</li>
<li>premature labor during the current pregnancy</li>
<li>ruptured membranes</li>
<li>preeclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension</li>
<li>severe anemia</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In addition to exercise contraindications, it is important educate pregnant clients regarding warning signs to discontinue exercise during pregnancy.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warning signs include:</strong>
<ul>
<li>vaginal bleeding</li>
<li>regular painful contractions</li>
<li>amniotic fluid leakage</li>
<li>dyspnea before exertion</li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>chest pain</li>
<li>muscle weakness affecting balance</li>
<li>calf pain or swelling</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exercise-considerations">Exercise Considerations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-considerations">#</a></h3>
<p><em>The principles of exercise prescription for healthy pregnant women do not differ from those for the general population. However, some special considerations should be noted with regard to exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Heart rate response to exercise may be blunted in pregnant women; therefore, <strong>the use of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) may be a more effective means to monitor exercise intensity during pregnancy.</strong></li>
<li>Due to the weight of the growing fetus, exercise for prolonged periods in the supine position may reduce venous return and cardiac output; therefore, <strong>exercise in the supine position after the 16th week of pregnancy should be avoided.</strong></li>
<li>During any exercise or activity, women who are pregnant should <strong>avoid using the Valsalva maneuver, prolonged isometric contractions, and motionless standing.</strong></li>
<li>High-intensity or prolonged exercise in excess of 45 minutes can lead to hypoglycemia; therefore, <strong>adequate caloric intake before exercise, or limiting the intensity or duration of exercise, is necessary to minimize risk.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pelvic floor exercises (e.g., Kegels) are recommended during pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period to decrease the risk of incontinence.</strong></li>
<li>Women who are pregnant should <strong>avoid exercising in a hot humid environment, stay well hydrated at all times, and dress appropriately to minimize the risk of heat stress.</strong></li>
<li>Pregnant women should <strong>avoid contact sports and activities that may cause a loss of balance or trauma to the mother or fetus.</strong></li>
<li>In addition, scuba diving should be avoided during pregnancy due to the inability of the fetal pulmonary circulation to filter bubble formation.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For more information regarding physical activity and exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period, please refer to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee Opinion Paper published in 2015, and the current edition of the American College of Sports Medicine&rsquo;s Guidelines to Exercise Testing and Prescription.</em></p>
<h2 id="older-adults">Older Adults<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#older-adults">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="physical-activity-benefits">Physical Activity Benefits<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#physical-activity-benefits">#</a></h3>
<p><em>According to the American College of Sports Medicine, older adults are defined as those 65 years and older, and individuals aged 50 to 64 years with clinically significant conditions or physical limitations that affect movement.</em></p>
<p>Regular physical activity is an essential component of healthy aging. In addition to the many health benefits gained by younger individuals, physical activity confers benefits that are particularly important for older adults.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, regular physical activity:
<ul>
<li>improves psychologic and cognitive well-being</li>
<li>prevents, delays, and helps to manage many chronic diseases</li>
<li>reduces the incidence of falls and injuries sustained from falls</li>
<li>facilitates independent living</li>
<li>increases the duration and quality of life</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical activity and exercise for older adults is especially important since this population is the least physically active of any age group.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity-recommendations">Physical Activity Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#physical-activity-recommendations">#</a></h3>
<p>The key physical activity recommendations are the same for both adults and older adults:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All older adults should avoid inactivity.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some physical activity is better than none, and older adults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For substantial health benefits, older adults should do <em>at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity</em>, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Aerobic activity should be performed in <em>episodes of at least 10 minutes</em>, and preferably, it should be spread throughout the week.</li>
<li>For additional and more extensive health benefits, older adults should increase their aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity, or 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond this amount.</strong></li>
<li>Older adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that are moderate or high intensity and involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exercise-considerations-1">Exercise Considerations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-considerations-1">#</a></h3>
<p>As noted previously, the physical activity recommendations and exercise guidelines for older adults are largely similar to those established for young and middle-aged adults; however, as with any special population group, some unique considerations do exist.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When older adults cannot do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week because of chronic conditions or physical limitations, they should <strong>be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Older adults should determine their level of effort for physical activity relative to their level of fitness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Whereas exercise intensity for younger adults is classified in absolute terms (i.e., METs), <strong>exercise and physical activity for older adults should be defined relative to the individual&rsquo;s level of fitness using a 10-point scale of perceived physical exertion</strong>, where 0 is considered sitting quietly and 10 is considered an ‘all-out' effort.</li>
<li><em>Moderate-intensity corresponds to a 5 or 6 and produces noticeable increases in heart rate and respiration; vigorous-intensity corresponds to a 7 or 8 and produces large increases in heart rate and respiration.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To reduce the risk of falling and injuries from falls, older adults should <strong>perform neuromotor exercises to improve balance, coordination, and proprioception</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Older adults should <strong>select exercise modalities and activities that do not impose excessive orthopedic stress</strong>, such as low-impact weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking, aquatic exercise, and stationary cycling, are preferable for those with limited tolerance to weight-bearing activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Older adults with chronic conditions should understand whether and how their health conditions affect their ability to do regular physical activity safely.</p>
<ul>
<li>Those with chronic disease such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or diabetes, must consider exercise considerations specific to those conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For more information regarding physical activity and exercise for older adults, please refer to chapter 5 of the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, and the current edition of the American College of Sports Medicine&rsquo;s Guidelines to Exercise Testing and Prescription, and ACSM&rsquo;s position stand paper regarding exercise for older adults.</em></p>
<h2 id="children--adolescents">Children &amp; Adolescents<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#children--adolescents">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="physical-activity-recommendations-1">Physical Activity Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#physical-activity-recommendations-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Regular physical activity among youth and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years is essential to promote health and fitness.</p>
<p>According to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Children and adolescents should do 60 minutes or more of physical activity daily.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most of the 60 or more minutes a day should be either <strong>moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity</strong>, and should include <strong>vigorous-intensity physical activity at least 3 days a week</strong>.</li>
<li>As part of their 60 or more minutes of daily physical activity, children and adolescents should include <strong>muscle-strengthening physical activity on at least 3 days</strong> of the week:
<ul>
<li>Unstructured play on playground equipment, climbing trees, tug-of-war, or for adolescents structured resistance training exercises, all of which provide an overload stimulus that strengthens muscles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As part of their 60 or more minutes of daily physical activity, children and adolescents should include <strong>bone-strengthening physical activity on at least 3 days</strong> of the week.
<ul>
<li>Bone-strengthening activities produce a force on bones that promotes bone growth and strength.</li>
<li>This force is often produced by impact with the ground while running or jumping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to encourage young people to participate in physical activities that are appropriate for their age, that are enjoyable, and that offer variety.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-considerations-2">Exercise Considerations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-considerations-2">#</a></h3>
<p>Generally, the exercise programming guidelines for healthy adults are applicable to children and adolescents. However, it is important to remember that children and adolescents are not simply mini adults and some programming modifications may be both needed to address the preferences and abilities of the youth population. In addition, exercise professionals should be mindful of the following considerations when working with this special population.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Youth must receive thorough instruction regarding proper resistance training technique, safety precautions, and appropriate program progression.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Youth must be both mentally and physically ready to comply with instructions and to withstand the stress of an appropriately-designed exercise training program.</li>
<li><em>Supervision and instruction should be provided by adults</em> having an understanding of youth training guidelines and knowledge of the unique physical and psychosocial characteristics of youth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Select stage appropriate activities and exercises.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stage of neurological and physical development will determine a child&rsquo;s ability to participate in organized activities requiring complex, coordinated movements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Due to immature thermoregulatory systems, youth should avoid prolonged vigorous exercise in hot humid environments, maintain proper hydration, and appropriately modify the intensity and duration of activity to avoid heat-related conditions such as heat exhaustion or heatstroke.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on enjoyment and self-improvement related to physical activity and exercise.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a positive experience to cultivate a life-long habit of regular physical activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Youth with disease or disability should have their exercise programs and physical activities modified to their condition, limitations, and level of physical fitness.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discourage time spent in sedentary activities such as watching television, playing video games, and &ldquo;surfing&rdquo; the Internet.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children limit total entertainment screen time to less than two hours per day.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>

<h1 id="section-2-medical-conditions">Section 2: Medical Conditions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-2-medical-conditions">#</a></h1>
<p>Section two will review exercise programing guidelines and considerations for those with medical conditions including:</p>
<ul>
<li>asthma</li>
<li>diabetes</li>
<li>hypertension</li>
<li>osteoporosis</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="asthma">Asthma<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#asthma">#</a></h2>
<p>Since 2001, the prevalence of asthma in the United States has increased by 1.5% annually. Asthma affected 25.7 million Americans in 2010, of which 7.0 million were children and 18.7 million were adults. Although for most the symptoms of asthma are only occasional and mild, for some, asthma can be a debilitating and potentially life-threatening disease.</p>
<p><strong>Asthma is a common pulmonary disorder characterized by chronic airway inflammation and periods of reversible airflow obstruction known as an asthma attack.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Airflow is obstructed by inflammation which leads to contraction of the smooth muscles lining the airways (i.e., bronchi, bronchioles).</li>
<li><em>This narrowing of the airways is called</em> <strong>bronchospasm</strong> or <strong>bronchoconstriction</strong>.</li>
<li>In addition, the cells lining the airways also overproduce mucus, contributing to further airway restriction.</li>
<li>An asthma attack often occurs in reaction to certain exposures such as airway infections, airborne allergens such as pollen, mold spores, dust mites, animal dander, environmental factors like cold and/or dry air, and airborne irritants including chemicals, tobacco smoke, and air pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Common symptoms</strong> of an asthma attack:
<ul>
<li>persistent coughing</li>
<li>wheezing</li>
<li>dyspnea (shortness of breath)</li>
<li>chest tightness or pain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Asthma attacks can range in severity from a nuisance to a life-threatening event.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exercise-induced-bronchospasm-and-asthma">Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm and Asthma<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-induced-bronchospasm-and-asthma">#</a></h3>
<p><em>Physical activity and exercise may also trigger bronchospasm among individuals with or without chronic asthma.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm (EIB)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the bronchospasm occurring during or immediately after exercise <em>for those without underlying asthma</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exercise-Induced Asthma (EIA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the bronchospasm occurring during or immediately after exercise <em>among those with asthma</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Common symptoms</strong> of exercise-induced bronchospasm and exercise-induced asthma (similar to other asthma attacks):</p>
<ul>
<li>persistent coughing</li>
<li>wheezing</li>
<li>chest tightness</li>
<li>dyspnea or shortness of breath</li>
<li>labored breathing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The bronchospasm and related symptoms typically begin within 6 to 8 minutes after the start of exercise and may peak 5 to 15 minutes after exercise has been ended.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment medication:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bronchospasm induced by exercise may be controlled or prevented through the use of short-acting inhaled b-agonist medications</em> (e.g., albuterol, levalbuterol) taken 15 minutes before exercise as directed by a physician.</li>
<li><em>Those with chronic asthma are also typically treated with inhaled corticosteroids</em>, which may play an additional role in the management of exercise-induced asthma and bronchospasm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although exercise may trigger an asthma attack, a recent systematic review of scientific literature indicates that higher levels of physical activity may provide protection against the development of chronic asthma.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-recommendations">Exercise Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-recommendations">#</a></h3>
<p>Similar to individuals with other chronic diseases, those individuals with poorly managed chronic asthma should consult with their physician prior to engaging in a new exercise program.</p>
<p>This section summarizes the key exercise programming recommendations for those with asthma:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequency:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Aerobic-type activity should be performed <em>at least 2 to 3 days per week</em>, yet ideally striving toward 3 to 5 days per week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Intensity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The exercise intensity should be <em>low-to-moderate based on the individual&rsquo;s level of fitness and limitations</em>.</li>
<li>The use of the Dyspnea Scale, the Talk Test, or a rating of perceived exertion may serve as good subjective guides regarding exercise intensity.</li>
<li>The American College of Sports Medicine recommends an intensity corresponding to 40% to 59% of heart rate reserve, progressing to 60% to 70%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The duration of aerobic exercise should be progressively increased to a least 30 to 40 minutes per day, as tolerated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Aerobic activities should include those utilizing the large muscle groups such as walking, cycling, or swimming, preferably in a non-chlorinated pool which is less likely to trigger an asthmatic episode.</li>
<li><em>The resistance training guidelines for individuals with asthma are the same as those recommended for healthy adults.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-considerations-and-precautions">Additional Considerations and Precautions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#additional-considerations-and-precautions">#</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the guidelines presented previously, it is important to also be aware of the following considerations and precautions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals experiencing an asthmatic episode should not exercise until symptoms and airway function have improved.</strong></li>
<li>Use of short-acting bronchodilators, as prescribed by a physician, may be necessary before or after exercise to prevent or manage exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.</li>
<li>Rescue medication should be available during exercise for use during an asthma attack.</li>
<li><strong>Closely monitor asthmatic clients for early signs of an asthma attack and respond immediately by reducing exercise intensity or terminating exercise.</strong></li>
<li>Call for medical help if symptoms do not subside with exercise modifications and/or self-administered medication.</li>
<li><strong>A prolonged and gradual warm-up and cool-down period should be utilized.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Limit or avoid exercise in environments that expose the individual to pollen, pollution, or cold air.</strong></li>
<li>Wearing a face mask during exercise in cold, dry air allows the air to be warmed and humidified to minimize onset of bronchospasm.</li>
<li><strong>Swimming and aquatic exercise tend to be better tolerated by asthmatic populations; however, pools with a high chlorine concentration may trigger asthmatic events.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Significant exercise modifications may not be necessary for those with mild or well-controlled asthma.</em></p>
<h2 id="diabetes">Diabetes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#diabetes">#</a></h2>
<p>Diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2015, representing nearly 80,000 deaths. In addition, diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities, thus contributing to the substantial health and economic burden imposed by diabetes in the United States and worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Diabetes Mellitus</strong> (or simply <strong>Diabetes</strong>)</p>
<ul>
<li>A group of metabolic diseases characterized by an elevated level of blood glucose as the result of insufficient insulin production and/or an inability to utilize insulin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two major types of diabetes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type 1 Diabetes</strong>
<ul>
<li>previously called <em>insulin-dependent or juvenile-onset diabetes</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes</strong>
<ul>
<li>previously called <em>non-insulin dependent or adult-onset diabetes</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="type-1">Type 1<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#type-1">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Insulin is a hormone that facilitates the uptake of glucose into cells.</li>
<li>When insulin production is insufficient, blood glucose levels rise causing hyperglycemia.</li>
<li>In adults, type 1 diabetes accounts for approximately 5% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="type-2">Type 2<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#type-2">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Type 2 diabetes typically begins with insulin resistance, a disorder in which the cells of the skeletal muscle, liver, and fat tissue do not use insulin properly.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As the need for insulin rises, the beta cells in the pancreas gradually lose the ability to produce a sufficient amount of insulin.</li>
<li>Obesity and physical inactivity each contribute to insulin resistance and are risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes.</li>
<li>In adults, type 2 diabetes accounts for about 90% to 95% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes.</li>
<li><em>Diabetes-specific complications, primarily involving small vessels, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, may lead to serious outcomes:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>visual disturbances or blindness</em></li>
<li><em>renal failure</em></li>
<li><em>gangrene or amputation</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Diabetes accelerates and exacerbates the occurrence of arteriosclerosis, increasing the risks of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.</em></p>
<h3 id="exercise-benefits">Exercise Benefits<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-benefits">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular physical activity, higher cardiorespiratory fitness, and healthy body weight are each associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes:</p>
<ul>
<li>increases insulin sensitivity</li>
<li>increases glucose uptake causing lowered blood glucose levels</li>
<li>reduces body fat</li>
<li>improves cardiovascular function</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, physical activity and exercise offer enormous benefits to individuals with diabetes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weight loss is the dominant predictor of lower risk for and incidence of type 2 diabetes, but increased physical activity reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes independent of weight loss.</li>
<li><em>Muscular contractions during exercise and physical activity increase glucose uptake into the cells and improve insulin sensitivity.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effects of a single bout of aerobic exercise on insulin action vary with duration, intensity, and subsequent diet, but <strong>a single session increases insulin action and glucose tolerance for 2 to 72 hours post-exercise</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exercise-recommendations-1">Exercise Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-recommendations-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Safe exercise participation can be complicated by the presence of diabetes-related health issues like CVD, hypertension, neuropathy, and microvascular changes; therefore, <em><strong>preparticipation evaluation and clearance by a physician is recommended prior to initiation of exercise for those with diabetes.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequency:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Aerobic exercise should be performed at least 3 days/week with no more than two consecutive days between bouts of exercise.</li>
<li><em>Ideally, diabetic individuals should strive toward 5 to 7 days/week of aerobic physical activity and exercise.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Intensity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Aerobic exercise should be performed at least at a moderate intensity, corresponding to approximately 40% to 60% of VO2R, 40% to 60% of HRR, or 65% to 75% of maximum heart rate.</li>
<li>Moderate-intensity may also correspond to a RPE of 5 to 6 on the 0 to 10 point scale.</li>
<li><em>Better blood glucose control may be achieved at higher intensities, so individuals should consider more vigorous exercise when appropriate.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Individuals with type 2 diabetes should engage in a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise or greater.</li>
<li>Additional benefits such as weight loss and healthy weight management are attained by increasing weekly physical activity to 300 minutes or more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Any form of aerobic exercise that uses large muscle groups and causes a sustainable elevation in heart rate is likely to be beneficial.</em></li>
<li>Personal interests, enjoyment, and desired goals of the exercise program should be considered when selecting the ideal mode of aerobic exercise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since most individuals with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes are likely to be overweight or obese, <strong>a combination of increased energy expenditure and decreased energy intake should be emphasized to create a caloric deficit that supports weight loss and healthy weight maintenance.</strong></p>
<p><em>A combination of aerobic and resistance training may be more effective for blood glucose management than either type of exercise alone.</em></p>
<p>The resistance training exercise guidelines for those with diabetes are generally the same as those for apparently healthy adults.</p>
<h3 id="hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#hypoglycemia">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>The risk of hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose level &lt; 70 mg/dL, during or after exercise is of great concern for those with diabetes.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>In diabetic individuals who use insulin, the combined effects of both exercise and insulin to increase glucose uptake can lead to hypoglycemic episodes.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Common Symptoms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>shakiness</li>
<li>weakness</li>
<li>abnormal sweating</li>
<li>nervousness</li>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>tingling of the mouth and fingers</li>
<li>hunger</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If pre-exercise blood glucose level is <em>less than 100 mg/dL</em>, the American Diabetes Association recommends that carbohydrates be ingested before any physical activity or exercise, but this applies only to individuals taking insulin and are therefore more susceptible to hypoglycemia.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Insulin users should likely consume 20 to 60 grams of carbohydrates before exercise for an initial blood glucose level of &lt; 100 mg/dL</em> with the actual amount of carbohydrate ingestion necessary being dependent upon insulin dosage and timing, pre-exercise blood glucose, and the planned exercise duration and intensity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s important to realize that hypoglycemia may be delayed and can occur up to 12 hours after exercise.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>In particular, vigorous-intensity exercise can result in substantial depletion of muscle glycogen, thereby increasing the risk for post-exercise hypoglycemia in those who use insulin.</em></li>
<li><em>In such cases, the consumption of 5 to 30 grams of carbohydrate during and within 30 minutes after glycogen-depleting exercise will lower the risk of hypoglycemia and facilitate more efficient replenishment of muscle glycogen.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medication dosage adjustments to prevent exercise-associated hypoglycemia may be necessary for individuals who use insulin.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Insulin must not be injected into exercising arms or legs.</em></li>
<li><em>Exercise sessions should be performed when insulin action is declining, for example, 2 hours after fast-acting insulin, or 3-4 hours after regular insulin injections.</em></li>
<li>Individuals will need to monitor blood glucose levels before, occasionally during, and after exercise and compensate with appropriate dietary and/or medication regimen changes, particularly when exercising at insulin peak times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diabetic clients must be carefully educated about the effects of physical activity on their blood glucose and the appropriate modifications of diet and insulin therapy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-considerations-and-precautions-1">Additional Considerations and Precautions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#additional-considerations-and-precautions-1">#</a></h3>
<p>It is also note the following considerations and precautions when working with diabetic clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>In diabetic individuals with retinopathy or macular degeneration, <strong>activities that greatly increase intraocular pressure, such as high-intensity aerobic or resistance training and head-down positions, are not recommended, nor are jumping or jarring activities</strong>, all of which increase hemorrhage risk.</li>
<li>All diabetic individuals (especially those with peripheral neuropathy) should <strong>closely examine their feet on a daily basis to detect sores or ulcers early</strong> and follow recommendations for use of proper footwear.</li>
<li>Anyone with a foot injury or open sore or ulcer should be restricted to non-weight-bearing activities.</li>
<li>Since diabetics are likely to have impaired thermoregulation, <strong>take proper precautions to avoid heat (e.g., heat exhaustion, heatstroke) and cold (hypothermia, frostbite) illnesses</strong>.</li>

<h3 id="exercise-benefits-1">Exercise Benefits<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-benefits-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Physical activity and exercise play an important role in the prevention and management of hypertension.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Exercise Hypotension</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dynamic exercise acutely reduces blood pressure below baseline levels for several hours after an exercise session.</em></li>
<li>Post-exercise hypotension is clinically significant, offering many hypertensive individuals the health benefit of having their blood pressure transiently lowered during the day when blood pressure is typically at its highest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Epidemiological studies have shown that there is an inverse relationship between physical activity and blood pressure such that increased levels of physical activity result in blood pressure reductions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular physical activity lowers blood pressure across all populations studied, with the most significant reductions observed among hypertensive individuals.</li>
<li>Among adults at all blood pressure levels, aerobic physical activity decreases systolic and diastolic blood pressure, on average by 2-5mmHg and 1-4mmHg, respectively.</li>
<li>The primary mechanism contributing to the decrease in blood pressure observed with regular physical activity is a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance.</li>
<li>Although some researchers have reported beneficial changes to systolic blood pressure as the result of resistance training, currently, the overall evidence does not provide consistent support for resistance training as an independent intervention for blood pressure reduction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exercise-recommendations-2">Exercise Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-recommendations-2">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>Those diagnosed with hypertension, particularly in the presence of additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, should undergo a preparticipation evaluation and obtain written clearance from a physician prior to beginning an exercise program.</strong></em></p>
<p>The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans are applicable and appropriate for those with hypertension.</p>
<p><em>Specifically, adults should strive to accumulate 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity.</em></p>
<p>Specific recommendations with regard to frequency, intensity, time, and type for both aerobic exercise and resistance training are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequency:</strong>
<ul>
<li>With regard to the frequency of aerobic exercise, since a single bout of exercise can cause an acute reduction in blood pressure that lasts several hours post-exercise, those with hypertension or at risk for hypertension should exercise on most, preferably all days of the week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Intensity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To maximize the benefits of aerobic physical activity, while mitigating potential adverse cardiovascular responses, hypertensive clients should exercise at a <em>moderate intensity</em> corresponding to 40 to 60% of heart rate reserve or a rating of perceived exertion corresponding to 5 or 6 on a scale of 0 to 10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The duration of time spent engaged in physical activity should accumulate to <em>30 to 60 minutes per day</em> of continuous or intermittent activity, with an emphasis placed on aerobic activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Overall, the resistance training recommendations for hypertensive individuals are similar to those for apparently healthy adults.</li>
<li>Time spent performing resistance training exercises should supplement time dedicated to aerobic activity.</li>
<li>Hypertensive individuals should <em>focus on dynamic resistance training that involves both a concentric and eccentric phase of muscular action</em>.</li>
<li><em><strong>Isometric or static resistance training exercises are generally considered to be contraindicated for those with hypertension.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-considerations-and-precautions-2">Additional Considerations and Precautions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#additional-considerations-and-precautions-2">#</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the recommendation presented previously, the following considerations and precautions should also be kept in mind when designing an exercise program for those with hypertension:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Individuals with uncontrolled severe hypertension (i.e., SBP ≥ 180mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110mmHg) should begin exercise training only after evaluation by their physician and beginning antihypertensive medication as prescribed by their doctor.</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Resting SBP ≥ 200mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110 is a relative contraindication to exercise.</strong></em></li>
<li><em>During exercise it is prudent to maintain SBP ≤ 220mmHg and/or DBP ≤ 105mmHg.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Resistance training is contraindicated for individuals with unstable angina, uncontrolled hypertension (SBP ≥ 160mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 100mmHg), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, a recent history of congestive heart failure, significant heart valve disease, or pathological enlargement of the heart.</strong></em></li>
<li><em>Since dynamic exercise leads to acute post-exercise hypotension, clients should be reminded to rise slowly from supine and seated positions to avoid a sudden drop in blood pressure associated with a change in posture (i.e., orthostatic hypotension).</em></li>
<li><em>Client&rsquo;s should be instructed on correct breathing patterns to avoid straining or performing the Valsalva maneuver during resistance training, which could cause a potentially dangerous elevation of blood pressure.</em></li>
<li><em>During resistance training, the individual should exhale during the concentric phase and inhale during the eccentric phase of the exercise.</em></li>
<li><em>Since many individuals with hypertension are also overweight or obese, the exercise program should emphasize a daily caloric expenditure of more than 300 kcal, coupled with reduced caloric intake to facilitate weight loss.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>By observing the recommendations and precautions presented in this section, exercise professionals can safely and effectively deliver exercise programming to individuals at risk for or diagnosed with hypertension.</p>
<h2 id="osteoporosis">Osteoporosis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#osteoporosis">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="pathophysiology">Pathophysiology<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pathophysiology">#</a></h3>
<p>Skeletal tissue is comprised of a collagen matrix, which gives bone flexible properties, and mineral content (i.e., calcium and phosphates), which provides the stiffness.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are two types of bones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cortical</strong> (or <strong>Compact Bone</strong>)
<ul>
<li>found mainly in the long shafts of bones and accounts for about 80% of all bone tissue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Trabecular</strong>
<ul>
<li>a spongy tissue having a lattice or honeycomb structure, and is found in the vertebrae, pelvis, flat bones, and ends of long bones</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bone is a dynamic tissue with the ability to grow and self-repair. The bone matrix consists of three types of bone cells:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Osteoclasts</strong>
<ul>
<li>bone-destroying cells that cause resorption of the bone tissue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Osteoblasts</strong>
<ul>
<li>bone-building cells that stimulate the formation of new bone tissue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Osteocytes</strong>
<ul>
<li>mature bone cells that help to regulate bone remodeling</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bone remodeling is a continuous process involving the coupled action of osteoclasts and osteoblasts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>osteoclasts first resorb (i.e., breakdown) older bone</strong></li>
<li><strong>osteoblasts subsequently form and mineralize new bone</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During periods of growth and maturation, the activity of osteoblasts exceeds osteoclasts, so bones grow, increase mineral density, and gain strength. After peak bone mass is attained, typically in the mid-to-late twenties, the activity of osteoclasts gradually outpaces osteoblasts leading to loss of bone mineral density and strength. The rate of bone loss is influenced by genetics, hormonal factors, dietary habits, and other lifestyle behaviors. If the loss of bone mineral density becomes significant, it may result in osteopenia or osteoporosis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mineral density and changes in the microstructure of bone leading to increased risk of fracture.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Osteoporosis is defined as a bone mineral density (BMD) value greater than 2.5 standard deviations below the young adult mean value.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exercise-benefits-2">Exercise Benefits<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-benefits-2">#</a></h3>
<p>Regular physical activity and exercise play an important role across the lifespan to reduce the risk and progression of osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Youth:</p>
<ul>
<li>During youth and adolescence, physical activities that generate relatively high loading forces, such as running, jumping, and hopping, promote increased bone mineral density and bone mass that are maintained into adulthood.</li>
<li>It is particularly important to encourage bone-loading activities among pre-pubescent children since there is evidence suggesting the positive impact on increased peak bone mass is more dramatic at this time and persists into adulthood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Young- to Mid-Adults:</p>
<ul>
<li>In healthy young and middle adulthood, weight-bearing exercise of sufficient magnitude to overload the skeleton should be performed.</li>
<li>It may be necessary to load the skeleton with greater than 2.5x body weight.</li>
<li>It is unclear if exercise can increase bone mineral density in aging adults, but studies do suggest that regular physical activity can attenuate the age-related decline in bone mineral density.</li>
</ul>
<p>Premenopausal Women:</p>
<ul>
<li>In premenopausal women, the findings from several meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of different modes of exercise on bone mineral density indicate that resistance training and high-impact weight-bearing exercise, alone or in combination, can produce 1% to 2% gains at the lumbar spine and femoral neck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Post-Menopausal Women:</p>
<ul>
<li>In older post-menopausal women, exercise may help to preserve bone mass; however, some women may still require hormone therapy to combat significant loss of bone mineral density.</li>
</ul>
<p>Older Adults:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular physical activity reduces the incidence of falls and fragility fractures among older adults.</li>
<li>Epidemiological evidence suggests that regular moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with a 30% to 50% lower incidence of vertebral or hip fractures in both men and women.</li>
<li>Studies have consistently demonstrated the beneficial effects of balance-oriented activities on the risk of falls and fall-related injuries.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exercise-recommendations-3">Exercise Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-recommendations-3">#</a></h3>
<p>The following recommendations are adopted from the American College of Sports Medicine&rsquo;s position stand titled, “Physical Activity and Bone Health” as well as other published articles.</p>
<p>Youth:</p>
<ul>
<li>For children and adolescents, <em>the mode of exercise should include impact activities such as running, jumping, and hopping, and sports such as gymnastics, soccer, and basketball, which involve increased ground reaction forces</em>.</li>
<li>In children, the most effective programs to promote bone health are those that incorporate <em>a combination of moderate- to high-impact weight-bearing activities that are multidirectional in nature and applied rapidly</em>.</li>
<li>The most successful exercise programs appear to be those that incorporate a wide variety of weight-bearing impact activities ranging in magnitude from 3 to 9 times body weight.</li>
<li>In addition, age-appropriate moderate-intensity resistance training is recommended; however, for safety reasons, the intensity should be &lt;60% of 1-repetition maximum and focused on moderate to high repetitions.</li>
<li>Bone-strengthening activities should be performed <em>at least 3 days per week for 10 to 20 minutes per session</em> and studies suggest that multiple shorter bouts of bone-loading exercise per day are more effective than a single longer bout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adults:</p>
<ul>
<li>For adults, <em>weight-bearing endurance activities such as walking, jogging, or stair climbing, and activities that involve jumping such as volleyball or basketball should be performed 3 to 5 times per week</em>.</li>
<li>In addition, adults should engage in <em>regular resistance training performed 2 to 3 days per week at a moderate- to high-intensity corresponding to 5 to 15 repetitions per set</em>.</li>
<li>For both overall and bone health, adults should strive toward <em>30 to 60 minutes of activity per day</em>.</li>
<li><em>Dynamic, multidirectional activities rather than static exercises should be favored</em> in the exercise program.</li>

<p>It is important to also be aware of some precautions when working with individuals at risk for or having osteoporosis:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Individuals with indications or confirmed diagnosis of osteoporosis should consult with a physician before beginning a resistance training program or impact activities.</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>High-risk populations should consult with their physician regarding the need for a bone density test.</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>High-risk populations: post-menopausal women, older adults, individuals of Caucasian or Asian descent, those with a family history of osteoporosis, small body frame, low calcium intake, history of eating disorders, receiving treatment for cancer in the past or at the present time, and women with indications of the female athlete triad such as amenorrhea and low energy intake.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Clients diagnosed with osteoporosis, with or without history of vertebral fracture, should not engage in jumping activities, explosive movements, high-impact loading, activities that cause twisting, deep forward flexion, or compression of the spine.</strong></em></li>

<h2 id="musculoskeletal-injuries">Musculoskeletal Injuries<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#musculoskeletal-injuries">#</a></h2>
<p>Exercise participants may suffer from a wide variety of exercise-related musculoskeletal injuries:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Acute Injury</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Occurs as a single and instantaneous incident of physical trauma to the body</li>
<li>Although often preventable, acute injuries are typically unpredictable and accidental in nature</li>
<li>Strains, sprains, and fractures are common accute injuries</li>
<li><strong>Strain</strong>
<ul>
<li>Occurs when muscle fibers and/or a tendon partially tears as the result of a forceful contraction or overstretching</li>
<li><em>More severe musculotendinous injuries involve complete full-thickness tears</em></li>
<li>Signs and symptoms of a mild strain may be minor such as slight swelling and discomfort, yet ranging to more significant symptoms such as increased swelling, hemorrhage, pain, tissue deformity, strength deficits, and loss of function in the case of partial or full-thickness tears</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sprain</strong>
<ul>
<li>An acute injury that damages a ligament</li>
<li>Sprains often occur when a joint undergoes a forceful or sudden motion that exceeds the joint&rsquo;s normal range of motion such as hyperextension, hyperflexion, or twisting.</li>
<li>A ligament sprain is characterized by pain, swelling, discoloration, joint instability, and loss of range of motion</li>
<li>In more severe cases, there may also be dislocation or deformity of the affected joint</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fracture</strong>
<ul>
<li>is a partial or complete break of a bone</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chronic Injury</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Develops more gradually and is not typically associated with a single incident</li>
<li>Chronic injuries occur in response to overuse, repetitive motions, inappropriate exercise technique, insufficient rest, poor body mechanics and postural alignment, or improper use of equipment</li>
<li>Symptoms of a chronic injury typically have a more gradual onset and are often associated with inflammation of soft tissue and pain</li>
<li>The suffix <strong>'-iitis'</strong> <em>indicates inflammation</em> as seen in the overuse injuries tendonitis, bursitis, and plantar fasciitis</li>
<li>Bones may also be subject to overuse injuries such as a stress fracture</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="care">Care<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#care">#</a></h3>
<p>Exercise and physical activity present a small yet inherent risk of injury. Therefore, it is important to be prepared to respond appropriately and provide immediate care for exercise-related injuries.</p>
<p>The recommended immediate care for most exercise-related injuries includes <strong>PRICE: Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protection</strong>
<ul>
<li>Necessary to avoid further injury and undue stress to the injured site, which may delay the healing and recovery process</li>
<li>Protection may include application of a bandage, wrap, splint, or sling, and in the case of lower body injuries, the use of crunches to minimize weight bearing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rest</strong>
<ul>
<li>Restricted activity is required to reduce the metabolic demands of the injured tissue and to avoid increased blood flow to the injured site</li>
<li>Rest may permit some general activity, but the client must avoid any activity that induces stress to the injured area and thus can compromise the healing process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ice</strong>
<ul>
<li>Used to limit the injury-induced damage by reducing the temperature of the injured tissues and consequently reducing metabolic demand, inducing vasoconstriction, and limiting the bleeding, all of which help to control swelling</li>
<li>Ice can also provide an analgesic effect by increasing threshold levels in the free nerve endings and by increasing nerve conduction latency, which reduces the sensation of pain</li>
<li><em>Ice should be applied in intervals lasting approximately 20 minutes separated by 60 minutes uncovered before reapplication</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Compression</strong> is applied to stop hemorrhage and reduce swelling
<ul>
<li><em>Compression bandages should be applied distally and wrapped proximally</em></li>
<li>Compression should be applied to reduce swelling, but to otherwise permit normal blood circulation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Elevation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Elevation of the injured site above the level of the heart lowers the pressure in local blood vessels and helps to limit the bleeding</li>
<li>Elevation also increases drainage through the lymph vessels to further reduce swelling</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heat-related-disorders">Heat-Related Disorders<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#heat-related-disorders">#</a></h2>
<p>Heat-related disorders include exertional heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and exertional heatstroke. Environmental factors, such as high ambient air temperature, high relative humidity, low wind speed, and solar radiant heat contribute to excessive fluid loss (i.e., dehydration) and elevate core body temperature (i.e., hyperthermia) may lead to the development of heat-related disorders.</p>
<p><strong>Heat Cramps</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Painful involuntary <em>muscle spasms</em>, often affecting the lower extremities and abdomen, that may occur during or after prolonged strenuous exercise in the heat</li>
<li>Immediate care for exertional heat cramps:
<ul>
<li>rest</li>
<li>static stretching of the affected muscle groups</li>
<li>consumption of fluids and foods containing table salt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heat Exhaustion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Signs and symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>low blood pressure</li>
<li>elevated heart rate and respiratory rate</li>
<li><em>profuse sweating</em></li>
<li>slightly elevated core body temperature</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>weakness</li>
<li>nausea</li>
<li>irritability</li>
<li>decreased muscle coordination</li>
<li>skin appears ashen or <em>pale, clammy</em>, and often with &ldquo;goose bumps&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>An individual suspected of suffering from heat exhaustion should be moved into a shaded or air conditioned area, excess clothing should be removed, and fluids (e.g., water and/or sports drink) should be consumed if the individual is able to swallow and is not vomiting.</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The individual should lay in a supine position with the legs elevated and monitored closely during recovery.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most individuals will respond favorably to prompt care; however, if symptoms do not improve or worsen, the individual should receive advanced emergency treatment from the appropriate personnel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exertional Heatstroke</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A life-threatening medical emergency</li>
<li>Heatstroke is defined as <strong>hyperthermia (i.e., core body temperature &gt; 104˚ F)</strong>, central nervous system dysfunction, and multiple organ system failure.</li>
<li>It is often difficult to discern severe heat exhaustion from heatstroke as many of the signs and symptoms are similar.</li>
<li><em><strong>Although the skin may initially appear sweaty and pale, classic heatstroke is characterized by hot, dry, and red skin.</strong></em></li>
<li>Symptoms of exertional heatstroke related to central nervous system dysfunction:
<ul>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>confusion</li>
<li>disorientation</li>
<li>irrational behavior</li>
<li>impaired balance and coordination</li>
<li>seizures</li>
<li>loss of consciousness</li>
<li>coma</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition, victims of heatstroke are likely to be severely dehydrated and may have symptoms such as:
<ul>
<li>tachycardia (i.e., heart rate &gt;100 beats/min)</li>
<li>hyperventilation</li>
<li>low blood pressure</li>
<li>vomiting</li>
<li>diarrhea</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>When exertional heatstroke is suspected, the emergency medical system should be activated immediately by calling 911.</em></li>
<li><strong>Successful treatment and survival from heatstroke requires immediate, whole-body cooling using cold water or ice water immersion.</strong></li>
<li><em>If whole-body immersion is not possible, then ice water towels should be applied on the head, torso, and extremities and ice packs applied to the neck, axillary region, and groin.</em></li>

<h3 id="prevention-strategies">Prevention Strategies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#prevention-strategies">#</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent the possible onset of serious heat-related disorders, the following strategies should be implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schedule activity during the cooler times of day or within a climate controlled environment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Allow a minimum of 10 to 14 days for acclimatization to hot and humid environments</strong></li>
<li>Gradually increase exercise intensity and duration during the period of acclimatization</li>
<li><strong>Monitor the environment for conditions that may increase the incidence of heat-related disorders</strong></li>
<li><strong>Conduct a preparticipation screening to identify those with a history of heat-related disorders</strong></li>
<li><strong>Monitor all individuals during exercise for signs and symptoms of heat stress</strong></li>
<li><strong>Educate participants regarding proper fluid intake</strong></li>
<li>Ensure adequate fluids are available during activity</li>
<li>Enforce fluid intake recommendations</li>
<li><strong>Monitor pre- and post-activity body weight to ensure adequate hydration and rehydration</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reduce exercise intensity and duration in high risk environmental conditions</strong></li>
<li>Plan for frequent breaks and rest periods</li>
<li><strong>Dress appropriately for the weather conditions</strong></li>
<li>Wear light weight, light colored, moisture-wicking clothing</li>
<li>Avoid clothing, materials, and equipment that create a vapor barrier inhibiting the evaporative cooling effect of sweat</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heart-attack">Heart Attack<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#heart-attack">#</a></h2>
<p>Although it is well-established that regular physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, <em><strong>strenuous physical exertion may trigger a heart attack</strong></em> (i.e., myocardial infarction), <em><strong>especially among those who do not exercise regularly</strong></em>. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of a heart attack and prepare to provide emergency care during these adverse events.</p>
<h3 id="warning-signs">Warning Signs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#warning-signs">#</a></h3>
<p>Recognizing the symptoms of a heart attack, prompt emergency care, and advanced life support is critical for survival.</p>
<p>Although sometimes the onset of symptoms may be very sudden and intense, <em>oftentimes heart attacks start slowly with only mild symptoms and discomforts</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>If a client appears to be having a heart attack, then call 911 immediately.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>The warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack may include:
<ul>
<li>prolonged or intermittent squeezing</li>
<li>pressure or pain in the chest, which may spread to the arms, shoulders, jaw, upper back, or upper abdomen</li>
<li>shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
<li>feelings of restlessness, apprehension, dizziness, or extreme weakness</li>
<li>nausea or vomiting</li>
<li>loss of consciousness</li>
<li>cold or clammy skin</li>
<li>bluish or ashen skin tone</li>
<li>absence of a pulse</li>
<li>and dilated pupils</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="immediate-care">Immediate Care<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#immediate-care">#</a></h3>
<p>The immediate care provided to a victim of a heart attack is critical to the outcome and survival from this adverse event.</p>
<p>The American Red Cross has outlined four steps in the <strong>“Cardiac Chain of Survival”</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>These four steps include:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>Early recognition of an adverse cardiovascular event and early activation of the emergency medical system (EMS) by <em><strong>calling 9-1-1</strong></em></li>
<li>Early administration of <em><strong>cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)</strong></em>, a life support method using both chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth ventilation
<ul>
<li><em>CPR helps to supply oxygen to the brain and other vital organs until advanced care arrives</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Early use of an <em><strong>automated external defibrillator (AED)</strong></em>
<ul>
<li><em>An AED delivers a small electrical shock to the heart that may be effective to restore normal heart rhythm</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Early arrival of <em><strong>advanced medical care</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>Trained EMS professionals are able to provide more advanced care and transportation of the victim to local emergency facilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="c-a-b">C-A-B<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#c-a-b">#</a></h4>
<p>In 2010, the American Heart Association changed the sequence of basic life support steps from A-B-C (airway, breathing, circulation) to C-A-B (chest compressions, airway, breathing).</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>When providing immediate care for a victim suspected of having a heart attack, first check for a pulse.</strong></em></li>
<li>If there is no pulse, begin <strong>chest compressions</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Chest compressions help circulate the oxygen-rich blood throughout the body</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After a series of chest compressions, open the victim&rsquo;s <strong>airway</strong> and check for signs of breathing
<ul>
<li>Look to see if the chest rises and falls</li>
<li>Listen near the mouth for breath sounds</li>
<li>Feel for air passing through the nose and mouth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the signs of breathing are absent, then begin rescue <strong>breathing</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>The purpose of rescue breathing is to supply oxygen via the cardiorespiratory system to the brain and vital organs</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Check for a pulse</em></li>
<li><strong>C</strong>hest compressions: if no pulse, then begin chest compressions immediately</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>irway: open victim&rsquo;s airway and check for signs of breathing</li>
<li><strong>B</strong>reathing: if no signs of breathing, then begin rescue breathing</li>
</ul>
<p><em>NETA -Certified Personal Trainers must hold and maintain an acceptable CPR and AED certification, which must include a live hands-on practical skills evaluation.</em></p>
<h2 id="stroke">Stroke<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#stroke">#</a></h2>
<p>A stroke is a condition that affects the arteries supplying oxygen-rich blood to and within the brain.</p>
<p><strong>A stroke occurs when an artery supplying the brain is either:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>blocked</strong>, known as an <em>ischemic stroke</em></li>
<li><strong>ruptures</strong>, known as a <em>hemorrhagic stroke</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, the part of the brain supplied by the affected artery cannot receive the vital oxygen and nutrients needed to survive, resulting in death of brain cells.</p>
<ul>
<li>The outcome of a stroke may include:
<ul>
<li>paralysis</li>
<li>physical disabilities</li>
<li>visual or speech impairments</li>
<li>memory loss</li>
<li>altered cognition</li>
<li>even death</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fast">FAST<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fast">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>An individual suspected of having a stroke requires immediate medical attention.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Early recognition and prompt activation of the emergency medical system is critical.</em></p>
<p>The American Stroke Association has developed an acronym, <strong>FAST</strong>, to help identify a stroke:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Face Drooping</strong>: Does one side of the face droop or is it numb?
<ul>
<li>Ask the person to smile.</li>
<li>Is the person&rsquo;s smile uneven or lopsided?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Arm Weakness</strong>: Is one arm weak or numb?
<ul>
<li>Ask the person to raise both arms.</li>
<li>Does one arm drift downward?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Speech Difficulty</strong>: Is speech slurred? Is the person unable to speak or hard to understand?
<ul>
<li>Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence, like “The sky is blue.”</li>
<li>Is the person able to correctly repeat the words?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time to call 911</strong>: If someone shows any of these symptoms, even if the symptoms go away, call 9-1-1 and say, &ldquo;I think this is a stroke&rdquo; to help get the person to the hospital immediately.
<ul>
<li>Time is important!</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t delay, and also <strong>note the time when the first symptoms appeared.</strong></li>
<li>Emergency responders will want to know.</li>

<h1 id="section-4-legal-considerations">Section 4: Legal Considerations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-4-legal-considerations">#</a></h1>
<p>Legal considerations represent an important matter for exercise professionals who deliver services such as fitness assessments, exercise instruction, and individualized exercise programming for their clients.</p>
<p>This section will review:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic legal concepts</li>
<li>common liability exposures</li>
<li>strategies to minimize risk for exercise professionals and their clients</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="standards-of-care--negligence">Standards of Care &amp; Negligence<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#standards-of-care--negligence">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="negligence">Negligence<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#negligence">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Negligence</strong> <em>is failing to act according to a generally accepted standard, or as a reasonable and prudent person would under the same or similar circumstances.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A negligent act can occur if a fitness professional:
<ul>
<li><strong>fails to act (i.e., act of omission)</strong> or</li>
<li><strong>acts inappropriately (i.e., act of commission)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, if a personal trainer does not administer appropriate preparticipation screening prior to training a new client, this may be viewed as a negligent act of omission.</li>
<li>If a personal trainer instructed a client with known shoulder impingement syndrome to perform the behind-the-head lat pulldown exercise, this may be viewed as a negligent act of commission.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="standards-of-care">Standards of Care<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#standards-of-care">#</a></h3>
<p>In the case of Personal Trainers, <em>a reasonable and prudent person is someone who adheres to the established standards of care</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Standards of Care</strong> (also known as <strong>Standards of Practice</strong>) <em>indicate the manner in which services should be delivered to provide reasonable assurance that the desired outcomes will be attained and ensuring the safety of the client.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Standards of care are represented by the various standards, guidelines, and recommendations published by professional organizations within the fitness industry such as ACSM, AHA, NSCA, and the Medical Fitness Association.</li>
<li>When an exercise professional accepts responsibility for providing a service, their performance is measured against the standard of care of a qualified professional in that situation.</li>
<li>Since attorneys, judges, and jurors cannot be expected to know the standards of care for various professions, expert witnesses are hired to educate the court and testify regarding the accepted and recognized standards.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The standards may evolve over time, so it&rsquo;s important that exercise professionals stay well-informed of developments and changes to the standards of care in their profession.</em></p>
<h3 id="elements-of-negligence">Elements of Negligence<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#elements-of-negligence">#</a></h3>
<p><em>In a negligence lawsuit, the burden of proof falls on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant acted negligently.</em></p>
<p><strong>There are four elements that must be demonstrated in order to establish negligence in the court of law.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Duty</strong> - <em>Did the defendant owe a legal duty to the plaintiff?</em>
<ul>
<li>The legal duty is an obligation or responsibility to provide services in a safe manner, to comply with accepted standards of care, and to protect the client from foreseeable injury.</li>
<li>The nature of the special relationship or agreement between the exercise professional and the client establishes a legal duty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Breach of Duty</strong> - <em>Did the defendant breach the legal duty owed to the plaintiff?</em>
<ul>
<li>In other words, did the action or inaction of the exercise professional violate the accepted standards of care, or was their conduct inconsistent with that of a reasonable and prudent person?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Damages</strong> - <em>Did the plaintiff suffer damages or losses due to the breach of duty?</em>
<ul>
<li>It must be demonstrated that the client suffered damages as the result of the exercise professional&rsquo;s negligent action or inaction.</li>
<li>Damages may be the specific injuries sustained and related pain and suffering, as well as economic damages such as medical expenses, lost wages, and loss of consortium.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Causation</strong> - <em>Did the breach of duty cause the harm or injury to the plaintiff?</em>
<ul>
<li>The exercise professional&rsquo;s breach of duty must be demonstrated to be the direct or proximate cause of the harm or injury to the client.</li>
<li>If the exercise professional had not breached their duty, then the accident and subsequent injury to the client would not have occurred.</li>
<li>In other words, if the exercise professional had acted appropriately, the client would not have been injured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="risk-management">Risk Management<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#risk-management">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Risk Management</strong> <em>is a proactive operational plan intended to minimize liability exposures, litigation, and losses for exercise professionals and the organizations they represent.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Step One</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify and assess existing and potential liability exposures.</strong></li>
<li><em>A liability exposure is any situation that creates the probability of harm, injury, medical emergency, or increased severity of medical emergencies.</em></li>
<li>Liability exposures are created when exercise professionals fail to adhere to published standards that have been established in the fitness industry.</li>
<li>The standards of care indicate the manner in which services should be delivered to provide reasonable assurance that the desired outcomes will be attained and ensuring the safety of the client.</li>
<li>Standards of care are represented by the various standards, guidelines, and recommendations published by professional organizations within the fitness industry such as ACSM, AHA, NSCA, and/or the Medical Fitness Association.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Step Two</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Develop strategies to minimize or, if possible, eliminate the liability exposures.</strong></li>
<li>This often includes the development of appropriate <strong>policies and procedures</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Step Three</strong>
<ul>
<li>Once developed, the next step is to put these strategies into practice through <strong>implementation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Step Four</strong>
<ul>
<li>The final step is the <strong>ongoing evaluation of the risk management plan to ensure compliance to the established policies and procedures</strong>, and effectiveness to minimize risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many potential liability exposures for exercise professionals and fitness facilities. Awareness of exposures and appropriate actions to address these concerns may mitigate potential litigation and strengthen the defense against lawsuits.</p>
<h2 id="liability-exposures">Liability Exposures<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#liability-exposures">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="preparticipation-screening">Preparticipation Screening<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#preparticipation-screening">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>The first liability exposure is failure to conduct proper preparticipation screening and, when indicated, referral for medical evaluation and clearance.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Exercise professionals must conduct appropriate preparticipation screening for their clients prior to starting an exercise program.</strong></p>
<p><em>The purpose of preparticipation health screening is to identify individuals who may be at elevated risk for exercise-related cardiovascular events, such as sudden cardiac death and/or acute myocardial infarction, or other complications during exercise.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>For most people, the risk of adverse cardiovascular events during exercise is very low, and the benefits of regular physical activity far outweigh this risk. However, the accumulating body of scientific evidence demonstrates an elevated risk of adverse cardiovascular events during and immediately following vigorous-intensity physical activity, especially among sedentary individuals who engage in unaccustomed exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preparticipation screening may be conducted using general screening tools, such as the widely-recognized Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q), or specific screening tools such as Health History Questionnaires and/or Health Risk Appraisals.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association have previously recommended pre-activity screening guidelines to identify those in need of medical evaluation and clearance based on risk classification as low-, moderate-, or high-risk.</li>
<li>These guidelines considered the presence of known cardiovascular, metabolic, or pulmonary disease, signs or symptoms suggestive of disease, and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors.</li>
<li>In November 2015, the ACSM released updated recommendations for preparticipation screening.</li>
<li><em><strong>The new ACSM exercise preparticipation health screening process is now based on:</strong></em>
<ul>
<li><strong>the individual&rsquo;s current level of physical activity</strong></li>
<li><strong>the presence of signs or symptoms and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease, and</strong></li>
<li><strong>the desired exercise intensity to be implemented in the individual&rsquo;s exercise program</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These three factors have been identified as important risk modulators of exercise-related cardiovascular events.</li>
<li><em>The new recommendations are intended to provide prudent screening while minimizing barriers to adopting physical activity. However, these updated recommendations should not replace sound judgment; and decisions regarding referral to a health care provider for medical clearance should continue to be made on an individual basis.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="healthfitness-assessments">Health/Fitness Assessments<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#healthfitness-assessments">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>Another potential liability exposure for exercise professionals is failure to conduct appropriate assessment of participant&rsquo;s fitness to determine indications and contraindications for exercise programming.</strong></em></p>
<p>Appropriately selected fitness assessments provide valuable information used to guide individualized program design and provide the basis for sound decision making with regard to the selection of exercises and acute training variables such as exercise intensity.</p>
<ul>
<li>In conjunction with preparticipation screening procedures, exercise professionals should <em>conduct health screening such as resting blood pressure, resting heart rate, and body mass index, which provide insight into the client&rsquo;s current state of health and risk for chronic disease</em>.</li>
<li>In addition, the exercise professional should <em>select and administer appropriate fitness assessments to evaluate the client&rsquo;s cardiorespiratory capacity, muscular fitness, flexibility, dynamic posture, and body composition</em>.</li>
<li>Of course, <em>fitness assessments must be performed according to standardized procedures and protocols, always observing both absolute and relative contraindications</em>, as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>The objective data and subjective observations arising from the health screening and fitness assessment protocols should be used to determine safe and appropriate initial exercise programming for the client.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-intensity">Exercise Intensity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-intensity">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>Another very preventable liability exposure is failure to &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; an appropriate exercise intensity (i.e. unnecessarily high intensity) in terms of metabolic, muscular, and cardiovascular demand.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Not only is high-intensity exercise unnecessary for many individuals who want to improve their health and fitness, but <em>high-intensity training may also increase the probability of injury and adverse cardiovascular events</em>.</li>
<li>Many clients will rely on and place trust in the expertise and good judgement of their personal trainers to advise them on safe and effective exercise intensity, as well as choice of exercise.</li>
<li>It is imperative that exercise professionals <em>consider the client&rsquo;s current health status, level of fitness, physical limitations, and personal goals to determine safe and appropriate exercises and intensity for their program</em>.</li>
<li>Exercise professionals should be familiar with and follow accepted exercise guidelines, such as those established by the American College of Sports Medicine.</li>
<li><strong>Previously sedentary individuals should always begin with low-to-moderate-intensity activities, and progress gradually as they adapt and become accustomed to regular exercise.</strong></li>
<li><em>Exercise professionals must be mindful of the client&rsquo;s level of exertion and respond appropriately to signs of overexertion and the client&rsquo;s feedback.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="supervision--instruction">Supervision &amp; Instruction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#supervision--instruction">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>Failure to adequately or competently supervise and/or instruct clients regarding the safe performance of recommended exercises and proper use of exercise equipment can lead to injury and creates a major liability exposure.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise professionals have a duty to <em>provide appropriate supervision and instruction to the client&rsquo;s they serve</em>.</li>
<li>Certainly, when a client is paying for individualized programming, a personal trainer must <em>carefully instruct and continually supervise the client to ensure he or she performs each exercise in a correct and safe manner</em>.</li>
<li>When working with a client or participant, the exercise professional must always be present, both physically and mentally; must be prudent, careful, and prepared; and must be aware to recognize and address potential safety concerns.</li>
<li>This vigilance extends beyond the specific exercises to also include awareness of the environmental surroundings and the actions of other individuals within the area.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scope-of-practice">Scope of Practice<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#scope-of-practice">#</a></h2>
<p><em><strong>Providing services or making statements outside the scope of practice for an exercise professional creates another source of potential liability and litigation.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Scope of Practice</strong> <em>defines the specific boundaries within which an individual (i.e., exercise professional) may perform the tasks associated with their profession.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise professionals who cross the line into the scope of licensed health professionals may face both criminal charges, like practicing dietetics or medicine without a license, and civil claims of negligence.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Exercise professionals must know and abide by the scope of practice limitations based on their education, credentials, knowledge, and skill.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recommendations">#</a></h3>
<p>Exercise professionals should adhere to the following recommendations to ensure they stay within their recognized scope of practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not diagnose illness, chronic disease, medical conditions, or injuries.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not make statements or offer opinions that may be misinterpreted as a diagnosis or medical advice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not attempt to rehabilitate or treat injuries, diseases, or medical conditions.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise professionals do not ‘prescribe' corrective or therapeutic exercises, but they do design exercise programs intended to improve overall health and/or one or more components of physical fitness.</li>
<li>The assessment of muscle imbalances, compensations, movement impairments, and other orthopedic issues, and the attempt to correct these issues using specific exercise interventions, is the job of a physical therapist and/or orthopedic specialist, not of the personal trainer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not counsel individuals with psychological disorders.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise professionals can and should use coaching skills to facilitate lifestyle behavior change, but should never attempt to counsel or treat individuals with known or suspected mental illness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not provide hands-on manipulation of soft tissue, such as massage or myofascial release, or perform musculoskeletal adjustments, such as &ldquo;cracking&rdquo; an individual&rsquo;s spine to realign vertebrae or relieve stiffness.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Certainly, exercise professionals may instruct clients on self-myofascial release techniques using foam rollers and other tools, but the client should always apply these techniques to themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not misrepresent health screening protocols or fitness assessments as a medical evaluation.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of a health history questionnaire, health risk appraisal, health screening measurements, and fitness assessments is, in part, to identify those who may require medical evaluation and clearance by a qualified health care provider before beginning an exercise program.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not make recommendations for an individual to alter their treatment plan, including medications, prescribed by a physician or other licensed health care provider.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When indicated, refer clients and participants to the appropriate health care provider for medical evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment.</strong></p>

<p>In addition, exercise professionals should adhere to the following recommendations specific to nutrition scope of practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not perform nutritional assessments to determine specific nutrient needs, excesses, deficiencies, or to recommend appropriate nutritional intake.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not design or prescribe specific meal plans or diets.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not provide or prescribe dietary recommendations intended to treat or manage illness, chronic disease, or other special medical considerations.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not recommend, encourage, provide, or sell dietary supplements or other ergogenic aids.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not promote or misrepresent yourself</strong> as a &ldquo;dietitian&rdquo;, &ldquo;registered dietitian&rdquo;, &ldquo;nutritionist&rdquo;, &ldquo;certified nutritionist&rdquo;, &ldquo;nutrition specialist&rdquo;, or any other occupational title using the word &ldquo;dietitian&rdquo; or &ldquo;nutritionist&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>In most states, the use of these titles is protected by law, restricting the use to only those licensed to practice dietetics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-licensed professionals, such as personal trainers and other exercise professionals, can provide only &ldquo;general non-medical&rdquo; nutrition information and guidance.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, non-medical nutrition information may include:
<ul>
<li>providing information about food-guidance systems such as MyPlate and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans</li>
<li>sharing examples of healthy versus unhealthy food choices and snacks</li>
<li>educating clients about carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water as essential nutrients needed for health</li>
<li>educating clients and providing statistical information about the relationship between chronic disease and the excess or deficiencies of certain nutrients</li>
<li>providing information about nutrients contained in foods or supplements and guiding clients to interpret Nutrition Facts labels</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#documentation">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>Failure to maintain appropriate documentation and records creates an unnecessary liability exposure and presents a challenge when trying to defend a lawsuit.</strong></em></p>
<p>Exercise professionals must maintain appropriate documentation including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Informed Consent</strong> (completed and signed by the client)</li>
<li><strong>Liability Waiver</strong> (also completed and signed by the client)</li>
<li><strong>Preparticipation Screening Forms</strong>
<ul>
<li>Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire</li>
<li>Health &amp; Lifestyle Questionnaire</li>
<li>Health Risk Appraisal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Medical Clearance to Participate</strong> (if necessary)</li>
<li><strong>Health/Fitness Assessment Data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Exercise Training Logs</strong>
<ul>
<li>detailed record of activities and exercises performed</li>
<li>acute training variables such as intensity, duration, workload, repetitions, tempo, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Progress Notes in SOAP Format</strong></li>
<li><strong>Communications with the Client&rsquo;s Physician or Other Health Care Providers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>All personally identifiable information and documentation, whether in paper or electronic format, maintained in conjunction with the delivery of fitness services must be treated as highly confidential and must be stored securely, such as a locked file cabinet or password-protected database.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Exercise professionals who interact with health care providers and other &ldquo;covered entitie:', and who obtain client&rsquo;s medical records in conjunction with the delivery of fitness services may be subject to compliance with HIPAA regulations. In these cases, exercise professionals should be familiar with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.</em></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="informed-consent">Informed Consent<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#informed-consent">#</a></h4>
<p>Exercise professionals and personal trainers have an important responsibility, both ethically and legally, to obtain an individual&rsquo;s informed consent prior to participation in a supervised exercise program.</p>
<p><strong>Informed Consent</strong> <em>is used to communicate important information to the participant prior to exercise testing or training.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The exact language contained within the Informed Consent document may vary based on the exercise setting and the type of assessments and/or exercise program being conducted.</li>
<li>However, the exercise professional must <em>ensure that the participant clearly understands the inherent risks and potential discomforts associated with the planned fitness assessments and activities</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When developing an Informed Consent, the following information must be included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provide an explanation of what the client will be performing as part of the exercise testing and/or training program, and the purpose or objective of the various assessments and program components.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Explain the inherent risks and potential discomforts associated with exercise.</strong>
<ul>
<li>For example, inherent risks may include:
<ul>
<li>muscle or joint injuries</li>
<li>abnormal blood pressure response</li>
<li>lightheadedness or fainting</li>
<li>irregular heart rhythm</li>
<li>in rare instances, heart attack, stroke or death</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Potential discomforts may include exertional shortness of breath and muscle fatigue and/or soreness.</li>
<li>For most people, the benefits of exercise and regular physical activity far outweigh the potential risks.</li>
<li>Well-documented health and fitness benefits obtained from participation in a regular exercise program should be highlighted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The participant must be aware of the importance of disclosing all relevant information regarding their current health status and past health history.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Participants must promptly report any unusual feelings or symptoms they experience during exercise.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Include a statement regarding confidentiality of personal and health information provided in conjunction with their exercise participation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The participant should be given the opportunity and encouraged to ask any questions they may have regarding the exercise testing or training program.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Include a statement indicating that the client is voluntarily participating and is free to stop at any time.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The client also acknowledges that they understand the inherent risks and are willingly consenting to participate.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Informed Consent should be administered properly to ensure the client has sufficient time to read the document and ask questions.</em></p>
<p><em>The Informed Consent should be communicated both verbally and in writing to ensure the client understands the inherent risks and other important considerations pertaining to their participation in the exercise testing and training program.</em></p>
<p>It is important to consult with a lawyer who is experienced with protective documents of this nature to ensure the Informed Consent is properly written and reflective of the law in your state.</p>

<h4 id="waiver--release-of-liability">Waiver &amp; Release of Liability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#waiver--release-of-liability">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Waiver and Release of Liability</strong> <em>is a document in which the participant knowingly releases the exercise professional and/or facility from responsibility and agrees to give up their rights to seek legal recourse and damages in the event of an injury sustained in conjunction with fitness programming.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Waivers and releases are generally recognized in most states for the release of ordinary negligence, but not for extreme forms of negligence such as gross negligence, reckless behavior, willful and wanton misconduct, and criminal acts.</li>
<li>The effectiveness of waivers has been debated.</li>
<li>A signed waiver and release of liability form may or may not be upheld in a court of law. However, it is still prudent to have participants sign a liability waiver form.</li>
<li>Since not all states uphold waiver forms, and laws regarding waivers vary from state to state, it is recommended to seek the advice of an attorney to construct a legally-defensible waiver form.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="progress-notes-soap">Progress Notes (SOAP)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#progress-notes-soap">#</a></h4>
<p>Fitness professionals should document pertinent information related to training sessions with their clients. Progress notes allow the personal trainer:</p>
<ul>
<li>A method to maintain a written record of the activities performed during a training session and the client&rsquo;s response to these activities</li>
<li>Provide a written record of any unusual events, outcomes, or problems associated with the exercise program or that may have been reported from outside of supervised training sessions</li>
<li>Demonstrate professionalism, compliance with standards of care, and may provide important documentation in defense of lawsuits</li>
</ul>
<p>A recognized approach to maintaining such documentation is known as <strong>SOAP</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subjective</strong>
<ul>
<li>The first component of a SOAP note contains <em>subjective information</em>, which includes any pertinent information, verbal or written, that is provided to the fitness professional <em>by the participant</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>
<ul>
<li>The second section of the SOAP note represents objective information that <em>may include measurements obtained, exercises performed, or data collected with regard to the exercises and activities completed during the session</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Assessment</strong>
<ul>
<li>The next section of the SOAP note is the assessment (not to be confused with a fitness assessment) but rather this assessment represents the fitness professional&rsquo;s <em>interpretations and observations of the client&rsquo;s performance, tolerance, progress, and outcomes</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Plan</strong>
<ul>
<li>The final component of the SOAP note is the plan.</li>
<li>The plan represents statements looking forward such as <em>expected outcomes, program progression or modification, new activities, and participant &ldquo;homework&rdquo; assignments.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>

<h4 id="certifications">Certifications<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#certifications">#</a></h4>
<p>Currently, the credentialing and certification of personal trainers is not regulated in the United States. Although many employers do require their personal trainers to hold a nationally-recognized certification, professional certification of personal trainers remains a voluntary process. However, obtaining and maintaining appropriate certifications is an industry standard established by recommendations from leading organizations such as the International Health, Racquet, and Sportsclub Association, the American College of Sports Medicine, and the Medical Fitness Association.</p>
<p><em><strong>Therefore, failure to obtain or maintain appropriate credentials, such as professional certification and safety certifications, creates a significant liability exposure for exercise professionals and fitness facilities who employ them.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2005, IHRSA&rsquo;s Board of Directors released the following recommendation for the association&rsquo;s member clubs:
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas, given the increasing importance of personal training in health, fitness and sports clubs, IHRSA recommends that as of January 1, 2006, member clubs hire personal trainers holding at least one current certification from a certifying organization/agency that has begun third-party accreditation of its certification procedures and protocols from an independent, experienced, and nationally recognized accrediting body.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When the recommendation was first issued, IHRSA&rsquo;s Board identified the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) as being an acceptable accrediting organization. Since then, the Board has also recognized the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (formerly known as the Distance Education Training Council) as an accrediting organization of education institutions. Many fitness organizations, including NETA, sought and earned the well-recognized and respected accreditation granted by the NCCA. Organizations that chose to pursue NCCA-accreditation for their certification programs recognized that it serves as the standard for many allied health professions such as registered dietitians, athletic trainers, nurse practitioners, occupational therapists, and an NCCA-accredited certification often serves as the requisite credential in professions regulated by individual states.</p>
<p><strong>All NCCA-accredited personal training certifications require the completion of continuing education in order to maintain the credential.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Therefore, personal trainers must engage in relevant continuing education and follow recertification procedures set forth by their certification provider in order to maintain their certification in good standing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In addition, to comply with recognized industry standards, personal trainers must obtain and maintain appropriate safety certifications including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillation (AED).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>In fact, most accredited personal training certifications require these safety certifications as a prerequisite.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Exercise professionals must take responsibility to keep all certifications in good standing and employers must perform their due diligence to verify that their staff hold appropriate credentials.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="emergency-response">Emergency Response<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#emergency-response">#</a></h4>
<p>Exercise professionals must hold appropriate safety certifications including CPR and AED. It is also highly recommended that exercise professionals hold certification in basic first aid.</p>
<p><em>Acting in their professional role, exercise professionals also have a duty to respond to life-threatening emergencies and provide appropriate care within the scope of their training. Failure to provide emergency aid or response may lead to litigation.</em></p>
<p>The American College of Sports Medicine has developed industry standards of care that call for health and fitness facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>to have a written emergency plan</li>
<li>to conduct regular emergency drills and cardiopulmonary resuscitation practice</li>
<li>to employ personnel trained for handling emergencies</li>
<li>to have automatic external defibrillators available for immediate use by trained personnel</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated in the ACSM and AHA joint position paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The AHA, the IHRSA, and the ACSM recommend that all health/fitness facilities have written emergency policies and procedures that are reviewed and practiced regularly. It is essential to acknowledge that emergency equipment alone does not save lives: training and preparedness by astute professional staff who can readily handle emergencies is paramount.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="liability-insurance">Liability Insurance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#liability-insurance">#</a></h4>
<p>Despite a thoughtful and well-executed risk management plan, lawsuits against exercise professionals are still an unfortunate reality. Therefore, it is important to have professional liability insurance.</p>
<p>NETA has teamed with FitnessPak to provide an insurance program that is tailored to the needs of fitness professionals, providing coverage for both professional liability and general liability exposures. With three different limits options, along with 1 or 2 year terms, there&rsquo;s an option to fit almost everyone&rsquo;s needs.</p>
