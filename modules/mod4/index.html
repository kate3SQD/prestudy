  "articleBody": "Section 1: Preparticipation Screening Participation in physical activity and exercise is not without risk. The risk of musculoskeletal injury, adverse cardiovascular events, and even sudden cardiac death increase during physical activity and exercise, particularly when performed at a vigorous intensity. However, for most the relative and absolute risk is small, and is far outweighed by the many health benefits of regular physical activity.\nThe overarching purpose of preparticipation screening:\n identify individuals who may be at elevated risk for exercise-related cardiovascular events identify those who should obtain medical clearance before beginning or progressing an exercise program  Although many sedentary individuals can safely begin a light-to-moderate intensity exercise program, all individuals should undergo an exercise preparticipation screening process to determine the need for medical clearance.\nSection one will review common preparticipation screening questionnaires and the current recommendations for exercise preparticipation health screening.\nPhysical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) PAR-Q Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q \u0026 You) is a commonly used general pre-activity screening tool developed by the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology.\n The PAR-Q may be used as a self-guided screening tool, or as a minimal screening tool administered by an exercise professional. The PAR-Q is a relatively simple one-page questionnaire including seven questions to be answered either ‘yes' or ‘no'. The PAR-Q is intended to identify major health conditions, signs or symptoms suggestive of coronary heart disease, medications, or other major medical conditions that may increase the participant’s risk of medical complications during exercise.  The simplicity and ease of use has contributed to its wide-spread popularity. However, the PAR-Q is not designed to provide great detail with regard to the participant’s entire health history or to detect all medical considerations.\nThe seven questions included on the PAR-Q include:\n Has your doctor ever said that you have a heart condition and that you should only do physical activity recommended by a doctor? Do you feel pain in your chest when you do physical activity? In the past month, have you had chest pain when you were not doing physical activity? Do you lose your balance because of dizziness or do you ever lose consciousness? Do you have a bone or joint problem that could be made worse by a change in your physical activity? Is your doctor currently prescribing drugs (for example, water pills) for your blood pressure or heart condition? Do you know of any other reason why you should not do physical activity?    Questions # 1, 2, and 3 are designed to identify known or suspected heart disease. Question # 4 is designed to establish if there are any symptoms that may indicate a life threatening disease. Question # 5 is designed to identify any musculoskeletal disorders. Question # 6 is designed to identify hypertension. Question # 7 is a very general question that is designed to identify any other issues that may limit exercise participation.  If the participant responds ‘yes' to any of the questions on the PAR-Q, then they should be directed to consult with their physician prior to beginning an exercise program.\nPAR-Q+ The PAR-Q was updated to the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone (PAR-Q+) in 2011, revised in 2014, and revised again in 2017.\nPAR-Q+ is a four page questionnaire including:\n questions similar to those on the original PAR-Q several additional follow-up questions to better guide preparticipation screening subsequent recommendations regarding medical clearance  The updated PAR-Q+ is evidence-based and was developed in part to minimize unnecessary barriers to physical activity for beginning an exercise program and to reduce false-positive screenings seen with the original PAR-Q.\nACSM Recommendations for Preparticipation Health Screening In November 2015, the American College of Sports Medicine published a Roundtable Consensus Statement titled:\nUpdating the ACSM’s Recommendations for Exercise Preparticipation Health Screening\nThe purpose of the ACSM’s exercise preparticipation health screening process is to identify individuals who may be at elevated risk for exercise-related sudden cardiac death and/or acute myocardial infarction (i.e., heart attack).\n Preparticipation health screening allows the exercise professional to determine:  when exercise participation is safe when individuals need to consult with a physician prior to participation in an exercise program    Vigorous-intensity exercise does present a small, yet measurable acute risk of CVD complications; therefore, mitigating this risk in susceptible individuals is important, both in terms of participant safety, but also liability risk management for exercise professionals.\nCompared to the previous ACSM recommendations, the updated exercise preparticipation health screening recommendations:\n Strongly supports the public health message that all people should adopt a physically-active lifestyle Reduce the emphasis on the need for medical evaluation in healthy, asymptomatic persons Emphasize identifying those with known disease because they are at greatest risk for an exercise-related cardiac event Simplify the exercise preparticipation screening process  The updated recommendations determine the need for medical clearance based on\n an individual’s current level of exercise the presence of major signs or symptoms of and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease and the desired exercise intensity  In the past, preparticipation screening has focused on risk classification placing individuals into low, moderate, or high risk categories based on the number of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and the presence of signs or symptoms of and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, and/or pulmonary disease.\nThe updated preparticipation screening recommendations:\n No longer includes the CVD risk factor profile as part of the decision making for referral to a health care provider prior to initiating a moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise program No longer recommends includes a low-, moderate-, and high-risk classification scheme Makes general recommendations for medical clearance versus specific recommendations for medical exams or exercise tests, leaving the manner of clearance to the discretion of the health care provider Does not automatically refer individuals with pulmonary disease for medical clearance prior to the initiation of an exercise program Continues to encourage preparticipation screening for persons interested in initiating or progressing exercise or other physical activity programs, Recognizes that vigorous-intensity exercise has a small but measurable acute risk of cardiovascular complications and mitigating this risk in susceptible individuals is important, and Continues to recommend that exercise professionals consult with health care providers when there are questions about individuals with known disease or signs and symptoms suggestive of disease, or any other concern about an individual’s ability to safely participate in an exercise program.  The new exercise preparticipation health screening recommendations are not a replacement for sound clinical judgment, and decisions about referral to a health care provider for medical clearance before the initiation of an exercise program should continue to be made on an individual basis.\n The new evidence-informed model for exercise preparticipation health screening is based on three factors:\n The individual’s current level of physical activity The presence of signs or symptoms and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease The individual’s desired or planned exercise intensity   Step 1: Identify the individual’s current level of physical activity\n Sedentary individuals are at greater total risk for acute cardiac events compared to their physically active counterparts. Studies have demonstrated that the risk of nonfatal heart attack and sudden cardiac death is significantly higher during vigorous-intensity physical activity compared to rest. However, research also reveals that the likelihood of exercise-related cardiovascular incidents and death during or immediately following vigorous exercise is lower among those who engage in regular physical activity. Therefore, the first step in the updated preparticipation screening process is to determine if an individual participates in regular exercise. This is defined as performing planned, structured physical activity at least 30 minutes at a moderate-intensity on at least 3 days per week for at least the last 3 consecutive months.*   Step 2: Identify the presence of signs or symptoms and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease\n The recognition of diagnosed cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal disease, and the identification of major signs or symptoms suggestive of these diseases is an important component of the preparticipation screening process and determination of the need for medical clearance. Therefore, it is important to identify the presence of known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease, or major signs or symptoms suggestive of disease.  At rest or during activity, the major signs or symptoms suggestive of underlying cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease include:\n Pain or discomfort in the chest, neck, jaw, arms, or other areas that may result from myocardial ischemia  i.e., inadequate blood supply to the heart   Shortness of breath at rest or with mild exertion  i.e., dyspnea   Dizziness or syncope  fainting or loss of consciousness   Orthopnea  shortness of breath while at rest in a reclined position that is promptly relieved by sitting upright or standing or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea shortness of breath beginning usually 2-5 hours after the onset of sleep, which is relieved by sitting upright on the side of the bed or getting out of bed   Ankle edema  swelling   Heart palpitations  an unpleasant awareness of the forceful or rapid beating of the heart or tachycardia abnormally rapid resting heart rate, usually greater than 100 b/min   Intermittent claudication  the pain that occurs in a muscle with inadequate blood supply, often the lower leg muscles when walking, which is relieved 1-2 minutes after exercise is stopped   Known heart murmur Unusual fatigue or shortness of breath with usual activities  For more information regarding the significance of each of these signs or symptoms, refer to the 10th edition of ACSM’s Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription (2018)\n Step 3: Identify the individual’s desired or planned exercise intensity\n In comparison to rest, light-, and moderate-intensity physical activity, vigorous-intensity exercise does present a small but measurable acute risk of adverse cardiovascular complications. Therefore, the desired exercise intensity is an important consideration when determining the need for referral to and medical clearance from a health care provider prior to beginning or progressing an exercise program. The third step is to determine the participant’s desired or planned exercise intensity, classified as light, moderate, or vigorous.  Exercise intensity may be defined using a number of different terms including a percentage of heart rate reserve (HRR) or oxygen consumption reserve (VO2R), metabolic equivalents (METs), or rating of perceived exertion (RPE):\n  Light-Intensity\n 30 to HRR or VO2R 2 to METs RPE of 9 to 11 on the category scale 2 to 4 on the category-ratio scale    Moderate-Intensity\n 40 to HRR or VO2R 3 to METs RPE of 12 to 13 on the category scale 5 to 6 on the category-ratio scale    Vigorous-Intensity\n ≥ 60% of HRR or VO2R ≥ 6 METs RPE of ≥ 14 on the category scale ≥ 7 on the category-ratio scale      Light Moderate Vigorous     Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) 30 to 40 to ≥ 60%   Oxygen Consumption Reserve (VO2R) 30 to 40 to ≥ 60%   Metabolic Equivalents (METs) 3 to ≥ 6   Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) - Category Scale 9 to 11 12 to 13 ≥14   Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) - Catetory-Ratio Scale 2 to 4 5 to 6 ≥ 7      For individuals who do not currently participate in regular exercise:\n  If the individual is ASYMPTOMATIC WITHOUT KNOWN cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease\n then medical clearance is NOT necessary prior to beginning a light- to moderate-intensity exercise program the individual may progress gradually to vigorous-intensity exercise according to ACSM’s exercise program guidelines    If the individual is ASYMPTOMATIC WITH KNOWN cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease\n then medical clearance IS recommended before beginning an exercise program the individual may gradually progress as tolerated, following ACSM’s exercise program guidelines    If the individual is SYMPTOMATIC WITH OR WITHOUT KNOWN cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease\n then medical clearance IS recommended before beginning an exercise program the individual may gradually progress as tolerated, following ACSM’s exercise program guidelines      For individuals who currently participate in regular exercise:\n  If the individual is ASYMPTOMATIC WITHOUT KNOWN cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease\n then medical clearance is NOT necessary Continue with a moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise program, progressing gradually according to ACSM’s exercise program guidelines    If the individual is ASYMPTOMATIC WITH KNOWN cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease\n then medical clearance IS recommended (within the last 12 months) before engaging in vigorous-intensity exercise however, medical clearance is not necessary to continue with moderate-intensity exercise    If the individual is SYMPTOMATIC WITH OR WITHOUT KNOWN cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease\n then the individual should discontinue exercise and obtain medical clearance from an appropriate health care provider      Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Cardiovascular disease has been the number one leading cause of death in the United States every year for nearly the last century.\nThe identification of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases is an important component of the exercise preparticipation screening process. Unlike the previous guidelines, the updated ACSM preparticipation screening recommendations do not include the identification of CVD risk factors or risk stratification. Nevertheless, it is important to continue to complete a CVD risk factor appraisal with their clients, even though it is no longer part of the decision-making logic model used to identify those individuals who may require medical clearance prior to exercise.\nEpidemiologic studies have revealed several risk factors having a strong association with the development of cardiovascular disease:\n Some risk factors, such as age and family history, are uncontrollable. Other factors are directly or indirectly related to lifestyle behaviors, such as cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity. These are considered controllable risk factors.  Positive Risk Factors Positive risk factors are those that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease:\n Age Family history Cigarette smoking Physical inactivity Obesity Hypertension Dyslipidemia Diabetes  Certain risk factors are likely to place an individual at greater risk than others. The presence of multiple risk factors may increase the overall risk for CVD exponentially.\n   Positive Risk Factors Defining Criteria     Age Men ≥ 45 yrs; Women ≥ 55 yrs   Family history Myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or sudden death before 55 yrs in father or other male first-degree relative, or before 65 yrs in mother or other female first-degree relative   Cigarette smoking Current cigarette smoker or those who quit within the previous 6 months, or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke   Physical inactivity Not participating in at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on at least 3 days per week for at least 3 months   Obesity Body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2 or waist circumference  102 cm (40 in) for men and  88 cm (35 in) for women   Hypertension Systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, confirmed by measurements on at least two separate occasions, or on antihypertensive medication   Dyslipidemia LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL or HDL-C   Diabetes Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, 2 hr plasma glucose values in oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 200 mg/dL, or HBA1c ≥ 6.5%    Negative Risk Factors Negative risk factors are those that decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease:\n High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level ≥ 60 mg/dL is a negative risk factor In other words, a high HDL-C level is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease     Negative Risk Factors Defining Criteria     HDL-C ≥ 60 mg/dL    Health \u0026 Lifestyle Questionnaire Although the PAR-Q and PAR-Q+ are convenient and validated preparticipation screening tools, they may be lacking the detail necessary to complete a thorough evaluation of health status. Therefore, a more comprehensive Health \u0026 Lifestyle Questionnaire may also be administered with new participants.\nA Health \u0026 Lifestyle Questionnaires helps the exercise professional to identify those who may require additional medical evaluation and clearance prior to engaging in physical activity.\nIn addition, this information provides invaluable insight to guide the exercise professional through their needs analysis and decision-making process for the development of an appropriate and individualized exercise program.\nA well-designed Personal Health \u0026 Lifestyle Questionnaire should address the following areas:\n Medical diagnoses and history of medical procedures Previous physical examination findings  e.g., heart murmurs, ankle edema, hypertension, abnormal pulmonary sounds   Recent laboratory findings  e.g., blood glucose, serum lipids and lipoproteins   History of signs or symptoms suggestive of disease Recent illness, hospitalization, new diagnoses, or surgical procedures Orthopedic problems Medication use  e.g., including dietary/nutritional supplements   Drug allergies Other habits including caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, or drug use Exercise and physical activity history Work/occupational history Family history of chronic diseases  The Personal Health \u0026 Lifestyle Questionnaire should be:\n completed prior to beginning fitness assessments or an exercise program updated periodically (e.g., every 6-12 months) to document any changes in the participant’s health status  Medical Clearance for Exercise Participation Medical clearance refers to written approval from a qualified health care provider to engage in exercise.\nThe need to refer an individual to a health care provider and to obtain medical clearance is based on:\n the participant’s current level of exercise the presence of signs or symptoms or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease the desired exercise intensity  Positive responses on the PAR-Q or PAR-Q+ plus may also signal a need to obtain medical clearance prior to beginning an exercise program.\nIn addition, although risk factors and risk stratification are no longer part of the ACSM’s preparticipation screening logic model, exercise professionals should still consider the presence of risk factors, use sound judgement, and make decisions regarding the need for participants to obtain medical clearance on an individual basis.\n Section 2: Health Screening Section two will review some common health screening evaluations to be implemented by exercise professionals as a component of the pre-exercise screening process, which include:\n resting heart rate blood pressure body mass index waist circumference waist-to-hip ratio  Resting Heart Rate Resting heart rate (RHR) can be manually counted by palpating either the radial pulse on the thumb side of the wrist, or the carotid pulse located on either side of the neck just lateral to the trachea.\n However, external pressure against the carotid artery may cause a reflexive slowing of the heart rate due to direct baroreceptor stimulation. Therefore, care should be taken to avoid applying too much pressure over carotid pulse site. Manual measurement of resting heart rate involves palpating the pulse using the first two fingers, then counting the number of beats per minute. Resting heart rate is most accurately measured by counting the number of beats for a full minute first thing in the morning before getting out of bed, and averaging the measurement over three consecutive days. Normal resting heart rate for an adult ranges from 60 to 90 beats per minute. In general, those with a higher level of cardiorespiratory fitness will have a relatively lower resting heart rate. Individuals taking antihypertensive medication such as beta-blockers may also have a low resting heart rate. A resting heart rate slower than 60 beats per minute is called bradycardia. A resting heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute is called tachycardia, which may be an indication of serious cardiac dysfunction. Since any number of conditions may cause an abnormally elevated resting heart rate, it’s important to advise participants to consult with a health care provider when unusual and/or consistent elevations in resting heart rate are obtained.  Resting Blood Pressure Measurement of resting blood pressure is an important component of the pre-exercise screening process.\nTo review the basic physiology of blood pressure, please refer to module two, section four.\nThe procedures for assessment of resting blood pressure are as follows:\n  The participant should be seated quietly for at least 5 minutes in a chair with back support with their feet on the floor and the arm supported at heart level\n The participant should refrain from ingesting caffeine for at least 30 minutes preceding the measurement    Wrap the blood pressure cuff firmly around upper arm at heart level; align cuff with brachial artery\n The appropriate cuff size must be used to ensure accurate measurement The bladder within the cuff should encircle at least 80% of the upper arm Many adults require a large adult cuff    Insert the stethoscope earpieces into your ears\n Place the diaphragm side of the stethoscope chest piece against the participant’s arm below the antecubital space over the brachial artery    Quickly inflate cuff pressure to 180-200 mmHg or at least 20 mmHg above the anticipated systolic pressure\n  Turning the bulb valve to the left, slowly deflate the cuff to release pressure at a rate of approximately 2-3 mm Hg per second\n  Listening with the stethoscope, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the point at which the first of two or more Korotkoff sounds is heard, and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is the point before the disappearance of Korotkoff sounds\n Note the SBP and DBP to the nearest mmHg    At least two measurements should be obtained (minimum of one minute apart), and the average should be recorded\n  The following provides the classification of blood pressure established by The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure:\n Normal blood pressure:  systolic pressure is less than 120 and diastolic pressure is less than 80   Prehypertension:  systolic pressure is between 120 and 139 or diastolic pressure is between 80 and 89   Hypertension:  systolic pressure equal to or greater than 140 or diastolic pressure equal to or greater than 90    Those individuals who fall within the prehypertensive category have twice the risk of developing hypertension than those who have a normal blood pressure.\n   Classification Systolic (mmHg)  Diastolic (mmHg)     Normal And   Prehypertension 120 - 139 Or 80 - 89   Hypertension      Stage 1 Hypertension 140 - 159 Or 90 - 99   Stage 2 Hypertension ≥ 160 Or ≥ 100     These classifications are based on the average of two or more properly measured blood pressure readings obtained in the seated position on two or more occasions. A diagnosis of hypertension may only be assigned by a qualified health care provider. An individual is also considered to be hypertensive if they take any antihypertensive medication to manage and control their high blood pressure. Lifestyle modification continues to be the first step in the primary and secondary prevention of hypertension. These lifestyle modifications include increased physical activity, weight loss, a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy with a reduction in saturated and total fat intake, reduced dietary sodium, and moderation of alcohol consumption.  Body Mass Index Body Mass Index (BMI) is used to assess weight relative to height and is calculated by dividing body weight in kilograms by height in meters squared (BMI = kg/m2)\n  For example, the BMI for an individual who is 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m) tall and weighs 155 pounds (70.3 kg) is calculated as follows:\n 70.3 divided by 1.73 squared, or 1.73 times 1.73, which is 2.99 Therefore, BMI equals 23.5 kg/m2  BMI = 70.3 / (1.73 * 1.73) BMI = 70.3 / 2.99 BMI = 23.5 kg/m2      Despite the widespread use of body mass index for the classification of overweight and obesity, BMI has been scrutinized as a valid indicator of health risk due to the inability of this measurement to differentiate fat weight from lean body weight.\n  In certain cases, an individual may have a healthy body composition (i.e., low percent of body fat), yet may also have a high BMI due to a larger proportion of lean body mass.\n  This may be especially true among strength-oriented athletes.\n  Although BMI fails to distinguish between body fat, muscle mass, or bone, it is well accepted that with the exception of individuals with large amounts of muscle mass, those with a BMI greater than 30 have excessive body fat.\n  An increased risk of obesity-related chronic diseases is associated with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2.\n  This table provides a summary of classifications according to BMI and the corresponding risk of disease:\n “Normal” corresponds to a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 “Overweight” corresponds to a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 “Obesity” corresponds to a BMI greater than or equal to 30     Classification BMI (kg/m2) Risk of Disease     Underweight –   Normal 18.5 - 24.9 Low   Overweight 25.0 - 29.9 Increased   Class 1 Obesity 30.0 - 34.9 High   Class 2 Obesity 35.0 - 39.9 Very High   Class 3 Obesity ≥ 40.0 Extremely High    Waist Circumference and Waist-to-Hip Ratio Waist Circumference Waist circumference may also be used to classify weight status and increased risk of obesity-related chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.\n  Measurement of waist circumference:\n subject standing arms at the sides feet together abdomen relaxed    A horizontal measure is taken at the narrowest part of the torso, above the umbilicus and below the xiphoid process.\n  A waist circumference greater than the numbers below is associated with increased risk of obesity-related disease:\n 102 centimeters (40 inches) for men 88 centimeters (35 inches) for women    Waist-to-Hip Ratio Since visceral adiposity (i.e., abdominal fat) presents a greater risk for obesity-related chronic disease, the waist-to-hip ratio is also an important component of the health screening process.\nThe waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is a measurement used to assess an individual’s regional fat distribution.\nWeight distribution patterns have been identified as an important indicator of health risks:\n  Android Obesity\n Those who store more body fat through the central region of the body (i.e., abdominal fat) Are at an increased risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and premature death as compared to gynoid obesity    Gynoid Obesity\n Fat distribution in the hips and thighs The “apple body” type presents more risk compared to the “pear body” type    The waist-to-hip ratio is calculated by dividing the waist circumference by the hip circumference.\n The measurement of hip circumference should be obtained with the subject standing with the legs slightly apart. A horizontal measure is taken at the maximal circumference of the hips, just below the gluteal fold. For example, a client having a waist measurement of 34 inches and a hip measurement of 36 inches has a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.94: (WHR = 34 / 36 = 0.94)  In general, the risk of obesity-related disease increases as the waist-to-hip ratio increases:\n Men: WHR greater than 0.95 Women WHR greater than 0.86  It has been shown that a 0.01 increase in waist-to-hip ratio is associated with a 5% increase in risk for cardiovascular disease.\n Section 3: Postural Analysis Section three will review postural screening and common postural deviations.\nMaintenance of proper posture and alignment is critical to avoid unnecessary musculoskeletal stress.\n Over time, poor posture may contribute to the onset of muscular imbalances, inefficient movement, and cumulative injuries resulting in shoulder, knee, neck, or low back pain. During exercise, it is imperative to maintain appropriate posture and joint alignment in order to both maximize neuromuscular efficiency and to reduce the risk of exercise-related injuries. Therefore, it is both important to screen and educate clients with regard to proper postural alignment.  The initial assessment of personal training clients should include a screen of static (i.e., stationary) and dynamic (i.e., moving) postural alignment to identify possible muscle weakness and tightness that may need to be addressed as a component of the overall fitness program.\nPostural Alignment Posture may be defined as the position of all body parts at any given time.\n Ideal posture aligns the body segments to minimize the muscular effort necessary to maintain biomechanical efficiency of the neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems. Proper postural alignment is critical for the maintenance of structural integrity, which is necessary to overcome the various forces and loads applied to the body. On the other hand, when an individual is chronically placing their body in a position of misalignment (i.e., poor posture), muscle imbalances, inefficient or restricted movement patterns, and cumulative musculoskeletal injury are likely to develop.  Static Plumb line is proper posture in the static standing position (although some individual variation exists).\nObserved from a lateral view, the plumb line is the imaginary vertical line that drops:\n from the ear through the center of the shoulder joint along the lateral midline of the trunk through the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae slightly anterior to the sacroiliac joint through the greater trochanter of the femur anterior to the midline of the knee (posterior to the patella) and slightly anterior to the lateral malleolus of the ankle    Observing a client from both a lateral and anterior view, the personal trainer may take note of five postural checkpoints including:\n Is the ear vertically aligned over the center of the shoulder? Are the scapula slightly retracted and depressed to position the center of the shoulder directly over the hip? Is a neutral position maintained through the lumbar spine with the core muscles engaged? Are the knees soft (not locked) with the patella facing forward and in line vertically with the center of the foot? Are the feet positioned hip-width apart with toes pointing forward and normal arches maintained through the medial aspects of the feet?  Pelvic Alignment Lumbo-Pelvic-Hip (LPH) region is affected by numerous muscles that attach to, cross over, and influence the position of the pelvis.\n  Neutral Lumbo-Pelvic-Hip Position (i.e., “neutral pelvis”)\n characterized by vertical alignment of the anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the pubic bone of the pelvis the lumbar spine maintains a natural lordotic curve (in the neutral position)    Anterior Pelvic Tilt\n the ASIS moves anteriorly (i.e., forward) relative to the pubic bone this anteriorly tilted pelvic position causes an increase lordotic curvature of the lumbar spine accompanied by shortening of the iliopsoas and erector spinae muscle groups    Posterior Pelvic Tilt\n the ASIS moves posteriorly (i.e., backward) relative to the pubic bone, resulting in a flattening of the lumbar spine accompanied by shortening of the hamstrings and rectus abdominis      Spinal Misalignments As the result of either structural anomalies or muscle imbalances, several misalignments of the spinal column may be observed:\n  Kyphosis\n excessive posterior curvature (i.e., convex rounding) of the thoracic spine rounded shoulders sunken chest forward head position, accompanied by hyperextension of the cervical spine (in more advanced cases of kyphosis, a characteristic ‘humpback' may be present)  Kyphosis may be attributed to poor posture and the resulting muscle imbalances, as well as more serious medical conditions such as spinal osteoporosis, vertebral fractures, degenerative disc disease, and Scheuermann’s disease.\n    Lordosis\n excessive anterior curvature (concave rounding) of the lumbar spine, accompanied by an anterior pelvic tilt weakness of the core abdominal muscles tightness of the erector spinae and hip flexor muscle groups      Flat-Back\n flexion of the upper thoracic spine straightening of the lower thoracic spine flexion (flattening) of the lumbar spine posterior pelvic tilt tight and overactive hamstring muscles* are commonly seen with flat-back posture      Sway-Back\n forward head position rounding of the thoracic spine displacement of the anterior ribs behind the hips a posterior pelvic tilt forward swaying of the pelvis over the feet hyperextended knees      Postural Distortion Patterns Postural distortion patterns is the combination of several postural and/or structural misalignments and the ensuing neuromuscular dysfunction.\n These postural distortion patterns can lead to fairly predictable muscle imbalances (i.e., weakness coupled with tightness). Clients who have developed postural distortion patterns may have trouble correctly performing certain exercises, which can reduce the effectiveness of their program and may contribute to cumulative injury. Understanding these postural distortion patterns and the related muscle imbalances will allow the exercise professional to identify safe and effective exercises to be incorporated into the client’s program.  Two commonly seen postural distortion patterns are upper cross syndrome and lower cross syndrome.\nUpper Cross Syndrome Upper Cross Syndrome (also known as Rounded Shoulder Syndrome)\n forward head position protracted and elevated scapula increased kyphosis forward-rounded shoulders  This postural deviation is typical of sedentary individuals and those who spend a great deal of time sitting at a desk, but can also result from overemphasis of one muscle group in training (e.g., chest), compensation due to injury, or even emotional distress.\nUpper cross syndrome typically involves functionally tight or overactive muscles as well as weak or inhibited muscles.\nThis is physiologically explained through a neuromuscular concept called:\n  Reciprocal Inhibition\n a tight, overactive agonist muscle will decrease or inhibit the neurological activation of its antagonist muscle, which results in functional weakness of this antagonist    Put simply, muscles that are shortened are over-stimulated by the nervous system and become dominant, whereas muscles that are lengthened are under stimulated by the nervous system and become weak or passive.\n  As such, upper cross syndrome typically involves functionally tight or overactive muscles as well as weak or inhibited muscles.\n  Muscle Imbalances with Upper Cross Syndrome\n   Tight/Dominant Muscles Weak Passive Muscles     Upper Trapezius Deep Cervical Flexors   Levator Scapula Serratus Anterior   Sternocleidomastoid Rhomboids   Pectoralis Major/Minor Posterior Deltoid   Latissimus Dorsi Middle \u0026 Lower Trapezius   Subscapularis Infraspinatus/Teres Minor    Lower Cross Syndrome Lower Cross Syndrome\n anterior pelvic tilt and a corresponding increase in lumbar lordosis internally rotated hips adducted (i.e., valgus) knees outwardly rotated feet  Lower cross syndrome also involves functionally tight or overactive muscles as well as weak or inhibited muscles, many of which may be observed when performing a body weight squat screen.\nLower cross syndrome typically involves tightness in the:\n hip flexors (i.e., iliopsoas) hamstrings hip adductors lower back calves (i.e., gastrocnemius, soleus)  The corresponding weak muscles groups may include the:\n gluteus maximus and medius rectus abdominis quadriceps tibialis anterior    Muscle Imbalances with Lower Cross Syndrome\n   Tight/Dominant Muscles Weak Passive Muscles     Iliopsoas Gluteus Maximus   Hamstrings Quadriceps (Rectus Femoris)   Hip Adductors Gluteus Medius/Minimus   Gastrocnemius Tibialis Anterior   Soleus Rectus Abdominis   Erector Spinae Transverse Abdominis   Iliotibial Band Internal \u0026 External Obliques    Dynamic Posture Movement Screening In addition to static postural alignment, it is also important to observe a client’s dynamic postural control and the ability to maintain alignment throughout the kinetic chain during movement and exercise.\nMovement screens may help:\n determine a client’s kinesthetic awareness identify movement compensations identify potential underlying muscle imbalances  Body Weight Squat Screen Body Weight Squat Screen, and other squat-based movement screens (e.g., bend and lift, overhead squat, deep squat), may be used to observe a client’s:\n postural control pelvic and core stability functional mobility, stability, and symmetry of the hips, knees, and ankles  To perform this movement screen:\n The participant begins by standing tall with feet positioned hip-width apart and toes pointing directly forward. Arms are raised overhead (if able) in a parallel position with the elbows fully extended. From a lateral view, the arms should be bisecting the ears. Instruct the participant to squat down as though sitting into a chair, pause, and return to the starting position with arms still reaching overhead. Repeat 5-10 repetitions in a slow and controlled manner. Observe the participant from the anterior and lateral views noting position and changes in alignment of the feet, ankles, knees, torso, arms, and head.  Note your observation based on the following checklist of questions:\n Do the feet turn outward? Do the arches of the feet flatten? Do the heels elevate off the floor? Do the knees move inward or adduct? Do the knees rotate inward? Does the torso lean excessively forward? Does the low back arch or round? Do the arms fall forward? Does the head fall forward out of alignment with the torso?  Upper Body Push Screen Upper Body Push Screen may be used to observe a client’s:\n postural control functional mobility, stability, and symmetry of the upper body  To perform this movement screen:\n Select an appropriate pushing movement such as a chest press performed on a selectorized machine or cable-based equipment. Performing the movement screen in a standing position will provide more information about the client’s whole body postural stability; whereas, a push-up may provide more information about the client’s core stability, but these options may be too demanding for some individuals. The choice of exercise should be determined based on the client’s perceived ability. Instruct participant to sit or stand, depending on mode of the pushing exercise, with feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward, lower back in neutral position with core muscles activated, shoulders vertically aligned with hips from lateral view, scapula retracted and depressed, and ears vertically aligned with center of shoulders from the lateral view. Using a light resistance, instruct the participant to perform the pressing movement, performing 10-15 repetitions in a slow and controlled manner.  Observe the participant from the anterior and lateral views noting observations based on the following checklist of questions:\n Does the low back arch or round? Do the shoulders elevate? Do the scapula protract with pushing? Does the head protrude forward?  Upper Body Pull Screen Upper Body Pull Screen may be used to observe a client’s:\n postural control and functional mobility, stability, and symmetry of the upper body  To perform this movement screen:\n Select an appropriate pulling movement such as a seated or standing row performed on a selectorized machine or cable-based equipment. Performing the movement screen in a standing position will provide more information about the client’s whole body postural stability; however, this position may be too demanding for some individuals. The choice of exercise should be determined based on the client’s perceived ability. Instruct participant to sit or stand, depending on mode of the pulling exercise, with feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward, lower back in neutral position with core muscles activated, shoulders vertically aligned with hips from lateral view, scapula retracted and depressed, and ears vertically aligned with center of shoulders from the lateral view. Using a light resistance, instruct the participant to pull the handles through a full range of motion, performing 10-15 repetitions in a slow and controlled manner.  Observe the participant from the anterior/posterior and lateral views noting observations based on the following checklist of questions:\n Does the low back arch or round? Do the shoulders elevate? Do the scapula protract (or upper back round forward) with pulling? Does the head protrude forward?  Interpretation of Movement Screens This table provides a list of possible interpretations corresponding to observations noted during squat, push, or pull movement screens.\nFor example, a personal trainer observed a client’s knees adduct inward into a valgus position while performing a body weight squat.\n This may suggest the client’s hip adductor muscle group may be tight or overactive. In addition, the client’s gluteus medius may be weak or underactive. Therefore, as part of the client’s program, the personal trainer should include a static stretch or self-myofascial release using a foam roller for the hip adductors, and a resistance exercise, such as standing hip abduction with a resistance band, to activate and strengthen the gluteus medius muscles.

This method can be quite accurate in comparison to the “gold standard” of hydrostatic weighing; however, it is highly dependent upon the skill and experience of the test administrator as well as the selection of population-specific protocols.  To ensure a valid and reliable estimation of body composition, the following standardized procedures should be used when performing skinfold testing:\n All measurements should be made on the right side of the body with the subject standing upright Caliper should be placed directly on the skin surface, 1 cm away from the thumb and finger, perpendicular to the skinfold, and halfway between the crest and base of the fold Pinch should be maintained while reading the caliper Wait 1-2 seconds (not longer) before reading the caliper Take duplicate measurements at each site and retest if the duplicate measurements are not within 1 to 2 mm Rotate through skinfold sites or allow time for the skin to regain normal texture and thickness  There are nine commonly used skinfold sites.\nThe standardized descriptions for these skinfold sites are provided in the table:\n   Skinfold Site Description     Abdominal Vertical fold; 2 cm to the right side of the umbilicus   Biceps Vertical fold; on the anterior aspect of the arm over the belly of the biceps muscle, 1 cm above the level used to mark the triceps site (see below)   Chest/Pectoral Diagonal fold; one-half the distance between the anterior axillary line and the nipple for men, or one-third of the distance for women   Medial Calf Vertical fold; at the maximum circumference of the calf on the midline of its medial border   Midaxillary Vertical fold; on the midaxillary line at the level of the xiphoid process of the sternum. An alternate method is horizontal fold taken at the level of the xiphoid/sternal border on the midaxillary line   Subscapular Diagonal fold (45-degree angle); 1-2 cm below the inferior angle of the scapula   Suprailiac Diagonal fold; in line with the natural angle of the iliac crest taken in the anterior axillary line immediately superior to the iliac crest   Thigh Vertical fold; on the anterior midline of the thigh, midway between the proximal border of the patella and the inguinal crease (hip)   Triceps Vertical fold; on the posterior midline of the upper arm, halfway between the acromion and olecranon processes, with the arm held freely to the side of the body    Two frequently-used protocols including three skinfold sites have been validated for both men and women:\n Men  skinfold measurements taken at the chest, abdominal, and thigh   Women  skinfold sites include the triceps, suprailiac, and thigh    In accordance with the standardized skinfold testing procedures, several (e.g., 2-3) measurements are obtained at each anatomical location until a consistent (i.e., within 1-2 mm) number is obtained.\n The average measurement obtained at each of the three skinfold sites is totaled together. The sum of the three skinfolds is then applied to a generalized skinfold equation to determine body density, which is then applied to a general or population-specific formula to convert body density to percent body fat. For convenience, body fat estimation tables have been created based on these calculations. Although normative data has been published, a consensus opinion for an exact percent body fat value associated with optimal health has not yet been established. However, a range of 10% to 22% for men and 20% to 32% for women is generally accepted as being satisfactory.  Cardiorespiratory Endurance Cardiorespiratory Endurance is the capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to the working muscles during continuous aerobic physical activity.\nCardiorespiratory endurance is an important component of a fitness evaluation since a low level of cardiorespiratory endurance has been directly correlated to a higher risk of premature death, heart disease, obesity, and many other chronic illnesses.\nCardiorespiratory endurance is typically represented by:\n Maximal Oxygen Consumption (VO2max)  the highest amount of oxygen that can be utilized by the skeletal muscles during maximal, exhaustive exercise Relative VO2max is expressed as milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute of exercise (mL/kg/min) VO2max may be measured directly through gas exchange analysis during a maximal graded exercise test (abbreviated GXT), estimated based on physiologic response to a submaximal test protocol, or estimated based on performance during a field-test    Graded Exercise Tests (GXT) Graded Exercise Test protocols are typically performed on a treadmill or stationary cycle during which the exercise intensity (i.e., workload) is gradually increased at set time intervals (typically 2-3 minutes) as the physiological responses such as oxygen consumption and heart rate are monitored.\nAs the exercise intensity increases, oxygen consumption will increase in a linear fashion.\nMaximal GXTs Maximal GXTs are performed up to the physiological maximum oxygen consumption, defined by a plateau in VO2max despite further increases to the exercise workload, or to the point of volitional fatigue.\nIf the subject needs to end the test due to fatigue before oxygen consumption plateaus, then it is considered a VO2peak versus VO2max.\n  Submaximal GXTs Submaximal GXTs are performed up to a predetermined end-point, typically 85% of age-predicted maximum heart rate.\n As the exercise intensity increases, there will be a corresponding linear increase in heart rate. The heart rate response to this submaximal intensity is then extrapolated out to the theoretical age-predicted maximum heart rate and the corresponding theoretical maximum intensity or workload that would have been attained had the test continued to maximum exertion. The subject’s estimated VO2max can then be calculated based on the predicted maximum workload.    During both maximal and submaximal graded exercise testing, the test is also terminated if adverse cardiovascular responses are observed or of course if the subject requests to stop.\nMaximal Graded Exercise Tests (Maximal GXTs) provides the most accurate data.\n However, an assessment of this nature requires expensive equipment and an experienced test administrator. In addition, maximal GXTs present more risk and may not be appropriate for many fitness participants. Subsequently, exercise professionals often utilize appropriate field-tests to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness.  Field Tests for Cardiorespiratory Fitness Field tests to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness utilize various modes of exercise, such as walking, running, and stepping, typically performed at a submaximal intensity. Field tests may be performed in a non-laboratory setting, require only minimal equipment, are inexpensive, and are easily administered by an exercise professional.\nUsing a field test, a client’s cardiorespiratory fitness may be estimated based on:\n Time to cover a specific distance (e.g., Rockport One-Mile Walk, Cooper 1.5 Mile Run) Distance covered within a specific duration of time (e.g., Cooper 12-minute Walk/Run) Recovery heart rate following a specific exercise workload (e.g., YMCA 3-Minute Step Test)  The specific protocol selected should be appropriate based on the participant’s goals, current level of fitness, health status, skill, and limitations.\nCommon field tests used to assess cardiorespiratory endurance:\n   Walk/Run Tests Step Tests     Rockport One-Mile Walk Test YMCA 3-Minute Step Test   Six-Minute Walk Test Queens College (McArdle) Step Test   Cooper 12-Minute Walk/Run Test Astrand-Ryhming Step Test   Cooper 1.5 Mile Run Test Harvard Step Test   PACER 20-Meter Shuffle Run Test Danish Step Test    Rockport One-Mile Walk Test The purpose of the Rockport One-Mile Walk Test is to assess:\n cardiorespiratory fitness classify fitness level monitor progress with an exercise program estimate VO2max  Equipment needed:\n stopwatch level one-mile course, preferably on an Olympic track (however, a treadmill may be used as necessary) 1 lap on an Olympic track is 400 meters, so 1 mile is 4 laps plus 9 meters (1 mile = 1,609 meters)  After explaining the purpose and procedures for the test:\n allow the participant a short warm-up period instruct participant to walk the one-mile course as quickly as possible upon completion of the one-mile walk:  record the participant’s time immediately obtain the participant’s post-walk 15-second heart rate    Published normative tables may be used to classify the participant’s cardiorespiratory fitness and/or the equation provided may be used to estimate maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max).\n Estimation of VO2max from One Mile Walk Test: VO2max(ml/kg/min) = 132.853 - 0.1692(weight) - 0.3877(age) + 6.315(gender) - 3.2649(time) - 0.1565(heart rate)  Example The client is a 47-year-old female who weighs 155 lbs (70.4 kg). She is able to complete the Rockport One-Mile Walk test in a time of 16 minutes and 24 seconds (16.4 minutes) with a 15-second heart rate of 38 (152 b/min). Calculate the client’s estimated VO2max using the equation that is provided.\n VO2max(ml/kg/min) = 132.853 - 0.1692(weight) - 0.3877(age) + 6.315(gender) - 3.2649(time) - 0.1565(heart rate) VO2max = 132.853 - 0.1692(70.4 kg) - 0.3877(47 yrs) + 6.315(0) - 3.2649(16.4 min) - 0.1656(152 b/min) VO2max = 132.853 - 11.91 - 18.22 + 0 - 53.54 - 23.79 VO2max = 25.4 ml/kg/min  Based on the client’s weight, age, gender, time to complete the one-mile walk, and post-walk heart rate, the client’s VO2max is estimated to be 25.4 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute.\nPlease note, candidates will not be expected to perform estimated VO2max calculations of this nature on the certification exam. However, candidates should be able to generally categorize or recognize a participant’s relative level of fitness based on performance during an assessment of this type.\n Cooper 12-Minute Walk/Run Test The 12-Minute Walk/Run Test was developed by Dr. Kenneth Cooper as a method of estimating cardiorespiratory fitness based on the maximal distance covered, either walking and/or running, in 12 minutes. Similar to the one-mile walk test, this field test is a convenient and cost-effective option requiring minimal equipment or skill.\nThis test may be more appropriate for conditioned individuals who are accustomed to moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity.\nThe purpose of the Cooper 12-Minute Walk/Run Test is to assess:\n cardiorespiratory fitness classify fitness level monitor progress with an exercise program estimate VO2max  Equipment needed:\n stopwatch Olympic track or flat measured course (however, a treadmill may be used as necessary)  After explaining the purpose and procedures for the test:\n allow the participant a short warm-up period instruct the participant to walk and/or run as far as possible in 12 minutes  the objective is to cover as much distance as possible within the allotted time walking is permitted, but the subject should be encouraged to challenge themselves as much as possible   upon completion of 12 minutes, record the total distance covered in meters  Published normative tables may be used to classify the participant’s cardiorespiratory fitness and/or the equation provided may be used to estimate maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max).\n Estimated VO2max from 12 Minute Walk/Run Test: VO2max(ml/kg/min) = (0.0268 x meters) - 11.3  Example A 34-year-old male client was able to cover a distance of 2,550 meters during the 12-Minute Walk/Run Test.\n VO2max(ml/kg/min) = (0.0268 x meters) - 11.3 VO2max = (0.0268 x 2,550) - 11.3 VO2max = 68.34 - 11.3 VO2max = 57.0 ml/kg/min  Based on the distance covered during this test, the client’s VO2max is estimated to be 57.0 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute.\nPlease note, candidates will not be expected to perform estimated VO2max calculations of this nature on the certification exam. However, candidates should be able to generally categorize or recognize a participant’s relative level of fitness based on performance during an assessment of this type.\n YMCA 3-Minute Step Test The YMCA 3-Minute Step Test may be used to categorize an individual’s level of cardiorespiratory fitness based on recovery heart rate following this standardized step test.\nThe YMCA step test uses a 12 inch step with a stepping rate of 24 step cycles per minute (96 foot contacts per minute), which is equivalent to an oxygen consumption of 25.8 mL/kg/min.\nThis test is appropriate for nearly all populations, although caution is warranted for those with knee and balance issues.\nThe purpose of the YMCA 3-Minute Step Test is to assess:\n cardiorespiratory fitness progress with fitness program  Equipment needed:\n stopwatch a metronome a 12-inch step  After explaining the purpose and procedures for the test:\n allow the participant to briefly practice proper stepping cadence with the metronome set to 96 beats per minute (24 step cycles per minute) once acclimated, the participant is ready to begin the test instruct the participant to step for three minutes keeping pace with the metronome alert the participant when one minute has elapsed, and again when one minute is remaining upon conclusion of three minutes of stepping, the participant immediately sits down and recovery heart rate is counted for a full minute, with the count starting within 5 seconds at the end of the stepping  The recovery heart rate value is used to obtain a qualitative rating of cardiorespiratory fitness using published normative tables.\n A lower recovery heart rate is indicative of a higher level of cardiorespiratory fitness. Since some blood pressure medications, such as beta-blockers, may suppress heart rate response to exercise, this assessment will not be a valid indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness for some individuals.  Several other step test protocols have also been developed.\n The various protocols may differ with regard to step height, stepping cadence, and/or duration of recovery heart rate. Exercise professionals are encouraged to select a mode of exercise and assessment protocol that is appropriate for the needs, abilities, and programming objectives of each individual client.  Muscular Strength Muscular strength is defined as the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to exert a maximum force against an external load.\nMuscular strength may be assessed and quantified using a One-Repetition Maximum (1RM) test performed on a specific exercise, such as a bench press or barbell squat.\n  Following an appropriate warm-up period, this method involves several sets of a specific exercise using progressively heavier workloads, with each set separated by a rest period.\n  Through trial-and-error, resistance is added for each subsequent set until the maximal amount of weight that can be lifted for a single repetition through a full range of motion with good form and technique is determined.\n  Since lifting a maximal workload is necessary, this method of testing dynamic muscular strength does present a higher risk for musculoskeletal injury, particularly when working with novice or deconditioned subjects.\n  Therefore, muscular strength may be predicted from a submaximal workload, which is lifted for a multiple repetition maximum, ideally 10-RM or less.\n  Using this method, predicted maximal strength is based on the inverse linear relationship between resistance lifted and repetitions performed, such that as the resistance increases, the maximal number of repetitions performed decreases and vice versa.\n  Predicted 1-RM Several formula’s have been developed to estimate one-repetition maximum based on a submaximal weight lifted for several repetitions to fatigue. Among these formula’s is the Brzycki Equation:\nPredicted 1-RM = Weight Lifted / 1.0278 - (0.0278 x reps to fatigue)\n To predict one-repetition maximum using this equation, select a submaximal resistance that will elicit fatigue within 10 or less repetitions. Enter the weight lifted and the number of repetitions performed to fatigue into the equation, and complete the calculations.  For example, if client was able to complete 7 repetitions to maximum effort on the bench press with 160 pounds, then the client’s estimated one-repetition maximum (1-RM) on the bench press is 192 pounds:\n Predicted 1-RM = Weight Lifted / 1.0278 - (0.0278 x reps to fatigue) Predicted 1-RM = 160 lb / 1.0278 - (0.0278 x 7 reps) Predicted 1-RM = 192 lb  Please note, candidates will not be expected to perform estimated 1-repetition maximum calculations of this nature on the certification exam. However, candidates should be able to generally categorize or recognize a participant’s relative level of muscular strength based on assessments of this type.\nThe table provided was developed from the Brzycki Equation and may be used for quick reference of predicted 1-repetition maximum without completing calculations.\n Using the info from the example provided, the intersection of 7 repetitions and 160 pounds indicates an estimated 1-RM of 192 pounds.     The Brzycki Equation has been validated on the bench press for sedentary or moderately-active young adult men. Although the use of this equation with other exercises and/or subject groups may yield less valid predictions of muscular strength, the estimations provided by this equation may allow for objective tracking of muscular strength development.  Muscular Endurance Muscular endurance is defined as the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to repeatedly exert submaximal force against a resistance over a period of time.\n Muscular endurance is typically assessed by having a participant perform as many repetitions as possible against a submaximal resistance or their own body weight. Many protocols used to assess muscular endurance involve calisthenic-type exercises such as push-ups, curl-ups, or pull-ups.  Push-Up Test The push-up test is a commonly used field test to assess upper body muscular endurance.\nThe push-up test is suitable for most populations with some considerations:\n Safe execution of the push-up test does require adequate shoulder complex and core stabilization. However, this test may serve a secondary objective to provide insight into the subject’s ability to stabilize the shoulder complex and core. The push-up test may be contraindicated for those with pre-existing shoulder injuries, wrist injuries, or other orthopedic limitations.  Performance:\n When performing the push-up test, men are typically in the full-body position, whereas women are typically in the modified position on their knees In either position, the hands are placed approximately shoulder-width apart and the anterior core muscles are engaged to maintain neutral hip and pelvic alignment The subject lowers body to 90 degrees of elbow flexion, then pushes up to the starting position with elbows fully extended The subject is instructed to perform the maximum number of repetitions possible with good form and technique Based on the maximum number of push-ups completed, the subject’s muscular endurance may be classified using published normative tables Individual progress may be monitored comparing future re-assessment results to the baseline number of push-ups performed  Partial Curl-Up Test The partial curl-up test may be used to assess abdominal muscular endurance.\nGenerally, this assessment is well-tolerated by most individuals. However, care should be used with those having low back and neck injuries.\nIn addition to the protocol presented, several other variations of the partial curl-up test have also been developed.\nPrior to the test:\n Mark off two sets of masking tape lines, one for left hand and one for right hand, approximately six inches long and 8 cm apart Set a metronome to 40 beats/min so the curl-ups are performed at a rate of 1 curl-up every 3 seconds or 20 per minute  Performance:\n The subject lies in the supine hook-lying position with knees bent at 90 degrees and feet flat on floor The subject begins with finger tips on the closest piece of masking tape and flexes the torso to ‘curl up' until the finger tips reach the second piece of tape The subject then returns to the starting position until the finger tips return to the first piece of tape The curl-up cadence is such that the finger tips slide to touch the first or second piece of tape with each beat of the metronome The subject continues without pausing until he or she can no longer perform the curl-ups at the rate established by the metronome and/or loses form, up to a maximum of 75 curl-ups The total number of curl-ups completed can be applied to published age- and gender-specific norms to classify the subject’s abdominal muscle endurance  Flexibility Flexibility is defined as the ability to move through a full, pain-free, range of motion.\nClinical Assessments:\n Using a goniometer or inclinometer, flexibility may be objectively measured in degrees during a specific movement, such as flexion or extension, around a joint Precise range of motion measurements of this nature are typical of clinical settings  Fitness Assessments:\n In fitness settings, flexibility is more commonly measured in inches or centimeters during linear movement of a body part or series of body segments Although these field tests of flexibility may be limited by precision of measurement and the inability to discern range of motion deficits at specific joints, they do provide a general indication of flexibility and functional movement  Just as measurements of muscular strength and endurance are specific to a muscle or group of muscles, flexibility is joint and movement specific. As such a single test to evaluate total body flexibility does not exist.\nSit-and-Reach Test The sit-and-reach test is commonly-used to assess flexibility of the hamstrings, posterior hips, and low back during flexion of the torso.\nAlthough this assessment is generally safe for most populations, it may be inappropriate for those with low back injury or orthopedic limitations at the hip.\nIt is preferable to administer this assessment using a sit-and-reach box, but modified protocols have been developed using other measurement tools such as a yard stick placed on the floor:\n The subject should complete a short cardiorespiratory warm-up prior to performing this test After removing their shoes, the subject sits with the heels of the feet flat against the sit-and-reach box, corresponding to the 15-inch mark The inner edges of the heels should be 6 inches apart Instruct the subject to slowly reach forward sliding both hands as far as possible along the ruler while flexing the torso, holding the greatest distance attained for 2 seconds The subject’s hands are to be kept one on top of the other, without leading with one hand or bouncing The fingertips should be in contact with the ruler on top the box at all times The knees should remain extended (i.e., straight), but not pressed down by the test administrator The subject’s score is the most distant point reached with the fingertips Record the best of three consecutive trials The subject’s flexibility may be classified using published age- and gender- specific normative tables   Tips for Fitness Assessments The final section of this module offers some tips for the administration and interpretation of fitness assessments.\n Practice and Prepare   The time to learn how to perform an assessment is not with your client in front of you Practice assessments with co-workers, friends, or family to perfect your skills before assessing clients Not only will it increase your credibility and professionalism, but it will also ensure valid and reliable assessment results for your client  Set the Stage   Take the time to prepare the assessment environment and the equipment before your client arrives Make sure the assessment room or space is large enough to accommodate the planned assessments Check the equipment to ensure it’s in good working order and properly calibrated when necessary Plan for an appropriate level of privacy when conducting assessments with your clients  Pick Proper Protocols   Although certain health screening and fitness assessment protocols should be routinely performed with all clients, others should be individually selected based on the goals, needs, and limitations of the specific client  Create Consistency   To ensure reliable pre- and post-assessment comparisons, it’s important to be consistent in terms of protocol, standardized procedures, equipment, testing sequence, pre-test instructions, and environment It may not be possible to replicate the exact same conditions every time, but greater consistency ensures greater reliability of measurements  Emphasize the Individual   Normative data is readily available for most fitness assessments; however, it’s important to understand what motivates your client Some may thrive on comparisons to others and being the “best,” while others may find it discouraging, particularly when fitness levels are below average or low Focus interpretation of data and goal-setting on individual improvements in personal health and fitness, rather than competing with others  Explore the Options   This module barely skims the surface of existing assessment protocols Many other fitness assessment options have been established and validated Take the time to familiarize yourself with other protocols including those that go beyond fitness assessment and into other dimensions of performance such as speed, power, agility, and balance  ",

<p>Participation in physical activity and exercise is not without risk. The risk of musculoskeletal injury, adverse cardiovascular events, and even sudden cardiac death increase during physical activity and exercise, particularly when performed at a vigorous intensity. However, for most the relative and absolute risk is small, and is far outweighed by the many health benefits of regular physical activity.</p>
<p><strong>The overarching purpose of preparticipation screening:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>identify individuals who may be at elevated risk for exercise-related cardiovascular events</strong></li>
<li><strong>identify those who should obtain medical clearance before beginning or progressing an exercise program</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Although many sedentary individuals can safely begin a light-to-moderate intensity exercise program, all individuals should undergo an exercise preparticipation screening process to determine the need for medical clearance.</em></p>
<p>Section one will review common preparticipation screening questionnaires and the current recommendations for exercise preparticipation health screening.</p>
<h2 id="physical-activity-readiness-questionnaire-par-q">Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#physical-activity-readiness-questionnaire-par-q">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="par-q">PAR-Q<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#par-q">#</a></h3>
<p>Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q &amp; You) is a commonly used general pre-activity screening tool developed by the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology.</p>
<ul>
<li>The PAR-Q may be used as a self-guided screening tool, or as a minimal screening tool administered by an exercise professional.</li>
<li><strong>The PAR-Q is a relatively simple one-page questionnaire including seven questions to be answered either ‘yes' or ‘no'.</strong></li>
<li>The PAR-Q is intended to identify major health conditions, signs or symptoms suggestive of coronary heart disease, medications, or other major medical conditions that may increase the participant&rsquo;s risk of medical complications during exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplicity and ease of use has contributed to its wide-spread popularity. However, the PAR-Q is not designed to provide great detail with regard to the participant&rsquo;s entire health history or to detect all medical considerations.</p>
<p><strong>The seven questions included on the PAR-Q include:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Has your doctor ever said that you have a heart condition and that you should only do physical activity recommended by a doctor?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you feel pain in your chest when you do physical activity?</strong></li>
<li><strong>In the past month, have you had chest pain when you were not doing physical activity?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you lose your balance because of dizziness or do you ever lose consciousness?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you have a bone or joint problem that could be made worse by a change in your physical activity?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is your doctor currently prescribing drugs (for example, water pills) for your blood pressure or heart condition?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you know of any other reason why you should not do physical activity?</strong></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Questions # 1, 2, and 3</strong> are designed to <em>identify known or suspected heart disease</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Question # 4</strong> is designed to establish if there are <em>any symptoms that may indicate a life threatening disease</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Question # 5</strong> is designed to <em>identify any musculoskeletal disorders</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Question # 6</strong> is designed to <em>identify hypertension</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Question # 7</strong> is a very general question that is designed to <em>identify any other issues that may limit exercise participation</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If the participant responds ‘yes' to any of the questions on the PAR-Q, then they should be directed to consult with their physician prior to beginning an exercise program.</em></p>
<h3 id="par-q-1">PAR-Q+<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#par-q-1">#</a></h3>
<p>The PAR-Q was updated to the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone (PAR-Q+) in 2011, revised in 2014, and revised again in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>PAR-Q+ is a four page questionnaire including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>questions similar to those on the original PAR-Q</strong></li>
<li><strong>several additional follow-up questions to better guide preparticipation screening</strong></li>
<li><strong>subsequent recommendations regarding medical clearance</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The updated PAR-Q+ is evidence-based and was developed in part to minimize unnecessary barriers to physical activity for beginning an exercise program and to reduce false-positive screenings seen with the original PAR-Q.</p>
<h2 id="acsm-recommendations-for-preparticipation-health-screening">ACSM Recommendations for Preparticipation Health Screening<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#acsm-recommendations-for-preparticipation-health-screening">#</a></h2>
<p>In November 2015, the American College of Sports Medicine published a Roundtable Consensus Statement titled:</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2015/11000/Updating_ACSM_s_Recommendations_for_Exercise.28.aspx"><em>Updating the ACSM&rsquo;s Recommendations for Exercise Preparticipation Health Screening</em></a></p>
<p><strong>The purpose of the ACSM&rsquo;s exercise preparticipation health screening process is to identify individuals who may be at elevated risk for exercise-related sudden cardiac death and/or acute myocardial infarction (i.e., heart attack).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Preparticipation health screening allows the exercise professional to determine:
<ul>
<li>when exercise participation is safe</li>
<li>when individuals need to consult with a physician prior to participation in an exercise program</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Vigorous-intensity exercise does present a small, yet measurable acute risk of CVD complications; therefore, mitigating this risk in susceptible individuals is important, both in terms of participant safety, but also liability risk management for exercise professionals.</em></p>
<p>Compared to the previous ACSM recommendations, the updated exercise preparticipation health screening recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strongly supports the public health message that all people should adopt a physically-active lifestyle</li>
<li>Reduce the emphasis on the need for medical evaluation in healthy, asymptomatic persons</li>
<li>Emphasize identifying those with known disease because they are at greatest risk for an exercise-related cardiac event</li>
<li>Simplify the exercise preparticipation screening process</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The updated recommendations determine the need for medical clearance based on</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>an individual&rsquo;s current level of exercise</strong></li>
<li><strong>the presence of major signs or symptoms of and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease</strong></li>
<li><strong>and the desired exercise intensity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the past, preparticipation screening has focused on risk classification placing individuals into low, moderate, or high risk categories based on the number of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and the presence of signs or symptoms of and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, and/or pulmonary disease.</p>
<p><strong>The updated preparticipation screening recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No longer includes the CVD risk factor profile as part of the decision making for referral to a health care provider prior to initiating a moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise program</li>
<li>No longer recommends includes a low-, moderate-, and high-risk classification scheme</li>
<li>Makes general recommendations for medical clearance versus specific recommendations for medical exams or exercise tests, leaving the manner of clearance to the discretion of the health care provider</li>
<li>Does not automatically refer individuals with pulmonary disease for medical clearance prior to the initiation of an exercise program</li>
<li>Continues to encourage preparticipation screening for persons interested in initiating or progressing exercise or other physical activity programs,</li>
<li>Recognizes that vigorous-intensity exercise has a small but measurable acute risk of cardiovascular complications and mitigating this risk in susceptible individuals is important, and</li>
<li>Continues to recommend that exercise professionals consult with health care providers when there are questions about individuals with known disease or signs and symptoms suggestive of disease, or any other concern about an individual&rsquo;s ability to safely participate in an exercise program.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The new exercise preparticipation health screening recommendations are not a replacement for sound clinical judgment, and decisions about referral to a health care provider for medical clearance before the initiation of an exercise program should continue to be made on an individual basis.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The new evidence-informed model for exercise preparticipation health screening is based on three factors:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The individual&rsquo;s current level of physical activity</strong></li>
<li><strong>The presence of signs or symptoms and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease</strong></li>
<li><strong>The individual&rsquo;s desired or planned exercise intensity</strong></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 1: Identify the individual&rsquo;s current level of physical activity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sedentary individuals are at greater total risk for acute cardiac events compared to their physically active counterparts.</li>
<li>Studies have demonstrated that the risk of nonfatal heart attack and sudden cardiac death is significantly higher during vigorous-intensity physical activity compared to rest.</li>
<li>However, research also reveals that the likelihood of exercise-related cardiovascular incidents and death during or immediately following vigorous exercise is lower among those who engage in regular physical activity.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, the first step in the updated preparticipation screening process is to determine if an individual participates in regular exercise.</strong></li>
<li>This is defined as performing planned, structured physical activity at least 30 minutes at a moderate-intensity on at least 3 days per week for at least the last 3 consecutive months.*</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 2: Identify the presence of signs or symptoms and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The recognition of diagnosed cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal disease, and the identification of major signs or symptoms suggestive of these diseases is an important component of the preparticipation screening process and determination of the need for medical clearance.</li>
<li>Therefore, it is important to identify the presence of known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease, or major signs or symptoms suggestive of disease.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>At rest or during activity, the major signs or symptoms suggestive of underlying cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease include:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Pain or discomfort in the chest, neck, jaw, arms, or other areas that may result from myocardial ischemia</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>i.e., inadequate blood supply to the heart</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Shortness of breath at rest or with mild exertion</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>i.e., dyspnea</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Dizziness or syncope</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>fainting or loss of consciousness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Orthopnea</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>shortness of breath while at rest in a reclined position that is promptly relieved by sitting upright or standing</li>
<li><em><strong>or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea</strong></em></li>
<li>shortness of breath beginning usually 2-5 hours after the onset of sleep, which is relieved by sitting upright on the side of the bed or getting out of bed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Ankle edema</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>swelling</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Heart palpitations</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>an unpleasant awareness of the forceful or rapid beating of the heart</li>
<li><em><strong>or tachycardia</strong></em></li>
<li>abnormally rapid resting heart rate, usually greater than 100 b/min</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Intermittent claudication</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>the pain that occurs in a muscle with inadequate blood supply, often the lower leg muscles when walking, which is relieved 1-2 minutes after exercise is stopped</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Known heart murmur</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Unusual fatigue or shortness of breath with usual activities</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>For more information regarding the significance of each of these signs or symptoms, refer to the 10th edition of ACSM&rsquo;s Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription (2018)</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3: Identify the individual&rsquo;s desired or planned exercise intensity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In comparison to rest, light-, and moderate-intensity physical activity, vigorous-intensity exercise does present a small but measurable acute risk of adverse cardiovascular complications.</li>
<li>Therefore, the desired exercise intensity is an important consideration when determining the need for referral to and medical clearance from a health care provider prior to beginning or progressing an exercise program.</li>
<li>The third step is to determine the participant&rsquo;s desired or planned exercise intensity, classified as light, moderate, or vigorous.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exercise intensity may be defined using a number of different terms including a percentage of <em>heart rate reserve (HRR)</em> or <em>oxygen consumption reserve (VO2R)</em>, <em>metabolic equivalents (METs)</em>, or <em>rating of perceived exertion (RPE)</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Light-Intensity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>30 to &lt; 40% of <em>HRR</em> or <em>VO2R</em></li>
<li>2 to &lt; 3 <em>METs</em></li>
<li><em>RPE</em> of 9 to 11 on the <em>category scale</em></li>
<li>2 to 4 on the <em>category-ratio scale</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moderate-Intensity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>40 to &lt; 60% of <em>HRR</em> or <em>VO2R</em></li>
<li>3 to &lt; 6 <em>METs</em></li>
<li><em>RPE</em> of 12 to 13 on the <em>category scale</em></li>
<li>5 to 6 on the <em>category-ratio scale</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vigorous-Intensity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>≥ 60% of <em>HRR</em> or <em>VO2R</em></li>
<li>≥ 6 <em>METs</em></li>
<li><em>RPE</em> of ≥ 14 on the <em>category scale</em></li>

<h2 id="risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-cvd">Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-cvd">#</a></h2>
<p>Cardiovascular disease has been the number one leading cause of death in the United States every year for nearly the last century.</p>
<p>The identification of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases is an important component of the exercise preparticipation screening process. Unlike the previous guidelines, the updated ACSM preparticipation screening recommendations do not include the identification of CVD risk factors or risk stratification. Nevertheless, it is important to continue to complete a CVD risk factor appraisal with their clients, even though it is no longer part of the decision-making logic model used to identify those individuals who may require medical clearance prior to exercise.</p>
<p>Epidemiologic studies have revealed several risk factors having a strong association with the development of cardiovascular disease:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Some risk factors, such as age and family history, are uncontrollable.</em></li>
<li><em>Other factors are directly or indirectly related to lifestyle behaviors, such as cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity. These are considered controllable risk factors.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="positive-risk-factors">Positive Risk Factors<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#positive-risk-factors">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Positive risk factors are those that <em>increase</em> the risk of cardiovascular disease:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Family history</li>
<li>Cigarette smoking</li>
<li>Physical inactivity</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Hypertension</li>
<li>Dyslipidemia</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain risk factors are likely to place an individual at greater risk than others. The presence of multiple risk factors may increase the overall risk for CVD exponentially.</p>

<h2 id="health--lifestyle-questionnaire">Health &amp; Lifestyle Questionnaire<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#health--lifestyle-questionnaire">#</a></h2>
<p>Although the PAR-Q and PAR-Q+ are convenient and validated preparticipation screening tools, they may be lacking the detail necessary to complete a thorough evaluation of health status. Therefore, a more comprehensive Health &amp; Lifestyle Questionnaire may also be administered with new participants.</p>
<p><strong>A Health &amp; Lifestyle Questionnaires helps the exercise professional to identify those who may require additional medical evaluation and clearance prior to engaging in physical activity.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, this information provides invaluable insight to guide the exercise professional through their needs analysis and decision-making process for the development of an appropriate and individualized exercise program.</p>
<p><strong>A well-designed Personal Health &amp; Lifestyle Questionnaire should address the following areas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medical diagnoses and history of medical procedures</strong></li>
<li><strong>Previous physical examination findings</strong>
<ul>
<li>e.g., heart murmurs, ankle edema, hypertension, abnormal pulmonary sounds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Recent laboratory findings</strong>
<ul>
<li>e.g., blood glucose, serum lipids and lipoproteins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>History of signs or symptoms suggestive of disease</strong></li>
<li><strong>Recent illness, hospitalization, new diagnoses, or surgical procedures</strong></li>
<li><strong>Orthopedic problems</strong></li>
<li><strong>Medication use</strong>
<ul>
<li>e.g., including dietary/nutritional supplements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Drug allergies</strong></li>
<li><strong>Other habits including caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, or drug use</strong></li>
<li><strong>Exercise and physical activity history</strong></li>
<li><strong>Work/occupational history</strong></li>
<li><strong>Family history of chronic diseases</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>The Personal Health &amp; Lifestyle Questionnaire should be:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>completed prior to beginning fitness assessments or an exercise program</em></li>
<li><em>updated periodically</em> (e.g., every 6-12 months) to document any changes in the participant&rsquo;s health status</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medical-clearance-for-exercise-participation">Medical Clearance for Exercise Participation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#medical-clearance-for-exercise-participation">#</a></h2>
<p><em>Medical clearance refers to written approval from a qualified health care provider to engage in exercise.</em></p>
<p><strong>The need to refer an individual to a health care provider and to obtain medical clearance is based on:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the participant&rsquo;s current level of exercise</strong></li>
<li><strong>the presence of signs or symptoms or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease</strong></li>
<li><strong>the desired exercise intensity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Positive responses on the PAR-Q or PAR-Q+ plus may also signal a need to obtain medical clearance prior to beginning an exercise program.</p>
<p>In addition, although risk factors and risk stratification are no longer part of the ACSM&rsquo;s preparticipation screening logic model, exercise professionals should still consider the presence of risk factors, use sound judgement, and make decisions regarding the need for participants to obtain medical clearance on an individual basis.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="section-2-health-screening">Section 2: Health Screening<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-2-health-screening">#</a></h1>
<p>Section two will review some common health screening evaluations to be implemented by exercise professionals as a component of the pre-exercise screening process, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>resting heart rate</li>
<li>blood pressure</li>
<li>body mass index</li>
<li>waist circumference</li>
<li>waist-to-hip ratio</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resting-heart-rate">Resting Heart Rate<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#resting-heart-rate">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Resting heart rate (RHR)</strong> can be manually counted by palpating either the radial pulse on the thumb side of the wrist, or the carotid pulse located on either side of the neck just lateral to the trachea.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, external pressure against the carotid artery may cause a reflexive slowing of the heart rate due to direct baroreceptor stimulation.</li>
<li>Therefore, care should be taken to avoid applying too much pressure over carotid pulse site.</li>
<li>Manual measurement of resting heart rate involves palpating the pulse using the first two fingers, then counting the number of beats per minute.</li>
<li>Resting heart rate is most accurately measured by counting the number of beats for a full minute first thing in the morning before getting out of bed, and averaging the measurement over three consecutive days.</li>
<li><strong>Normal resting heart rate for an adult ranges from 60 to 90 beats per minute.</strong></li>
<li><em>In general, those with a higher level of cardiorespiratory fitness will have a relatively lower resting heart rate.</em></li>
<li><em>Individuals taking antihypertensive medication such as beta-blockers may also have a low resting heart rate.</em></li>
<li><strong>A resting heart rate slower than 60 beats per minute is called bradycardia.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A resting heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute is called tachycardia</strong>, which may be an indication of serious cardiac dysfunction.</li>
<li>Since any number of conditions may cause an abnormally elevated resting heart rate, it&rsquo;s important to advise participants to consult with a health care provider when unusual and/or consistent elevations in resting heart rate are obtained.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resting-blood-pressure">Resting Blood Pressure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#resting-blood-pressure">#</a></h2>
<p>Measurement of resting blood pressure is an important component of the pre-exercise screening process.</p>
<p><em>To review the basic physiology of blood pressure, please refer to module two, section four.</em></p>
<p><strong>The procedures for assessment of resting blood pressure are as follows:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The participant should be seated quietly for at least 5 minutes in a chair with back support with their feet on the floor and the arm supported at heart level</p>
<ul>
<li>The participant should refrain from ingesting caffeine for at least 30 minutes preceding the measurement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wrap the blood pressure cuff firmly around upper arm at heart level; align cuff with brachial artery</p>
<ul>
<li>The appropriate cuff size must be used to ensure accurate measurement</li>
<li>The bladder within the cuff should encircle at least 80% of the upper arm</li>
<li>Many adults require a large adult cuff</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<li>A diagnosis of hypertension may only be assigned by a qualified health care provider.</li>
<li>An individual is also considered to be hypertensive if they take any antihypertensive medication to manage and control their high blood pressure.</li>
<li>Lifestyle modification continues to be the first step in the primary and secondary prevention of hypertension.</li>
<li>These lifestyle modifications include increased physical activity, weight loss, a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy with a reduction in saturated and total fat intake, reduced dietary sodium, and moderation of alcohol consumption.</li>

<h2 id="body-mass-index">Body Mass Index<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#body-mass-index">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> is used to assess weight relative to height and is calculated by dividing body weight in kilograms by height in meters squared <em>(BMI = kg/m2)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, the BMI for an individual who is 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m) tall and weighs 155 pounds (70.3 kg) is calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>70.3 divided by 1.73 squared, or 1.73 times 1.73, which is 2.99</li>
<li>Therefore, BMI equals 23.5 kg/m2
<ul>
<li>BMI = 70.3 / (1.73 * 1.73)</li>
<li>BMI = 70.3 / 2.99</li>
<li>BMI = 23.5 kg/m2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the widespread use of body mass index for the classification of overweight and obesity, BMI has been scrutinized as a valid indicator of health risk due to the inability of this measurement to differentiate fat weight from lean body weight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In certain cases, an individual may have a healthy body composition (i.e., low percent of body fat), yet may also have a high BMI due to a larger proportion of lean body mass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This may be especially true among strength-oriented athletes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although BMI fails to distinguish between body fat, muscle mass, or bone, it is well accepted that with the exception of individuals with large amounts of muscle mass, those with a BMI greater than 30 have excessive body fat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An increased risk of obesity-related chronic diseases is associated with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This table provides a summary of classifications according to BMI and the corresponding risk of disease:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Normal&rdquo;</strong> corresponds to a BMI of <strong>18.5 to 24.9</strong></li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Overweight&rdquo;</strong> corresponds to a BMI of <strong>25.0 to 29.9</strong></li>

<h3 id="waist-circumference">Waist Circumference<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#waist-circumference">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Waist circumference</strong> may also be used to classify weight status and increased risk of obesity-related chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Measurement of waist circumference:</p>
<ul>
<li>subject standing</li>
<li>arms at the sides</li>
<li>feet together</li>
<li>abdomen relaxed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A horizontal measure is taken at the narrowest part of the torso, above the umbilicus and below the xiphoid process.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A waist circumference greater than the numbers below is associated with increased risk of obesity-related disease:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>102 centimeters (40 inches) for men</strong></li>
<li><strong>88 centimeters (35 inches) for women</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="waist-to-hip-ratio">Waist-to-Hip Ratio<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#waist-to-hip-ratio">#</a></h3>
<p>Since visceral adiposity (i.e., abdominal fat) presents a greater risk for obesity-related chronic disease, the waist-to-hip ratio is also an important component of the health screening process.</p>
<p><strong>The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is a measurement used to assess an individual&rsquo;s regional fat distribution.</strong></p>
<p>Weight distribution patterns have been identified as an important indicator of health risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Android Obesity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Those who store more body fat through the central region of the body (i.e., abdominal fat)</li>
<li>Are at an increased risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and premature death as compared to gynoid obesity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gynoid Obesity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fat distribution in the hips and thighs</li>
<li>The &ldquo;apple body&rdquo; type presents more risk compared to the &ldquo;pear body&rdquo; type</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The waist-to-hip ratio is calculated by dividing the waist circumference by the hip circumference.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The measurement of hip circumference should be obtained with the subject standing with the legs slightly apart.</li>
<li><strong>A horizontal measure is taken at the maximal circumference of the hips, just below the gluteal fold.</strong></li>
<li>For example, a client having a waist measurement of 34 inches and a hip measurement of 36 inches has a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.94: (WHR = 34 / 36 = 0.94)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In general, the risk of obesity-related disease increases as the waist-to-hip ratio increases:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Men: WHR greater than 0.95</li>
<li>Women WHR greater than 0.86</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It has been shown that a 0.01 increase in waist-to-hip ratio is associated with a 5% increase in risk for cardiovascular disease.</em></p>

<h1 id="section-3-postural-analysis">Section 3: Postural Analysis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-3-postural-analysis">#</a></h1>
<p>Section three will review postural screening and common postural deviations.</p>
<p><em>Maintenance of proper posture and alignment is critical to avoid unnecessary musculoskeletal stress.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Over time, poor posture may contribute to the onset of muscular imbalances, inefficient movement, and cumulative injuries resulting in shoulder, knee, neck, or low back pain.</li>
<li>During exercise, it is imperative to maintain appropriate posture and joint alignment in order to both maximize neuromuscular efficiency and to reduce the risk of exercise-related injuries.</li>
<li>Therefore, it is both important to screen and educate clients with regard to proper postural alignment.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>The initial assessment of personal training clients should include a screen of static (i.e., stationary) and dynamic (i.e., moving) postural alignment to identify possible muscle weakness and tightness that may need to be addressed as a component of the overall fitness program.</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="postural-alignment">Postural Alignment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#postural-alignment">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Posture</strong> may be defined as <em>the position of all body parts at any given time</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideal posture aligns the body segments to minimize the muscular effort necessary to maintain biomechanical efficiency of the neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems.</li>
<li>Proper postural alignment is critical for the maintenance of structural integrity, which is necessary to overcome the various forces and loads applied to the body.</li>
<li>On the other hand, when an individual is chronically placing their body in a position of misalignment (i.e., poor posture), muscle imbalances, inefficient or restricted movement patterns, and cumulative musculoskeletal injury are likely to develop.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="static">Static<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#static">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Plumb line</strong> is <em>proper posture in the static standing position</em> (although some individual variation exists).</p>
<p>Observed from a lateral view, the plumb line is the imaginary vertical line that drops:</p>
<ul>
<li>from the ear</li>
<li>through the center of the shoulder joint</li>
<li>along the lateral midline of the trunk</li>
<li>through the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae</li>
<li>slightly anterior to the sacroiliac joint</li>
<li>through the greater trochanter of the femur</li>
<li>anterior to the midline of the knee (posterior to the patella)</li>
<li>and slightly anterior to the lateral malleolus of the ankle</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod4/Plumb.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>Observing a client from both a lateral and anterior view, the personal trainer may take note of five postural checkpoints including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the ear vertically aligned over the center of the shoulder?</li>
<li>Are the scapula slightly retracted and depressed to position the center of the shoulder directly over the hip?</li>
<li>Is a neutral position maintained through the lumbar spine with the core muscles engaged?</li>
<li>Are the knees soft (not locked) with the patella facing forward and in line vertically with the center of the foot?</li>
<li>Are the feet positioned hip-width apart with toes pointing forward and normal arches maintained through the medial aspects of the feet?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="pelvic-alignment">Pelvic Alignment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pelvic-alignment">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Lumbo-Pelvic-Hip (LPH)</strong> region is affected by numerous muscles that attach to, cross over, and influence the position of the pelvis.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Neutral Lumbo-Pelvic-Hip Position (i.e., &ldquo;neutral pelvis&rdquo;)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>characterized by vertical alignment of the <em>anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS)</em> and the pubic bone of the pelvis</li>
<li><em>the lumbar spine maintains a natural lordotic curve</em> (in the neutral position)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anterior Pelvic Tilt</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the ASIS moves anteriorly (i.e., forward) relative to the pubic bone</li>
<li>this anteriorly tilted pelvic position causes an <em>increase lordotic curvature of the lumbar spine</em></li>
<li>accompanied by shortening of the iliopsoas and erector spinae muscle groups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Posterior Pelvic Tilt</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the ASIS moves posteriorly (i.e., backward) relative to the pubic bone, resulting in a flattening of the lumbar spine</li>
<li>accompanied by shortening of the hamstrings and rectus abdominis</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spinal-misalignments">Spinal Misalignments<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#spinal-misalignments">#</a></h2>
<p>As the result of either structural anomalies or muscle imbalances, several misalignments of the spinal column may be observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Kyphosis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>excessive posterior curvature (i.e., convex rounding) of the thoracic spine</em></li>
<li>rounded shoulders</li>
<li>sunken chest</li>
<li>forward head position, accompanied by hyperextension of the cervical spine</li>
<li>(in more advanced cases of kyphosis, a characteristic ‘humpback' may be present)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Kyphosis may be attributed to poor posture and the resulting muscle imbalances, as well as more serious medical conditions such as spinal osteoporosis, vertebral fractures, degenerative disc disease, and Scheuermann&rsquo;s disease.</em></p>

<h2 id="postural-distortion-patterns">Postural Distortion Patterns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#postural-distortion-patterns">#</a></h2>
<p>Postural distortion patterns is the combination of several postural and/or structural misalignments and the ensuing neuromuscular dysfunction.</p>
<ul>
<li>These postural distortion patterns can lead to fairly predictable muscle imbalances (i.e., weakness coupled with tightness).</li>
<li>Clients who have developed postural distortion patterns may have trouble correctly performing certain exercises, which can reduce the effectiveness of their program and may contribute to cumulative injury.</li>
<li>Understanding these postural distortion patterns and the related muscle imbalances will allow the exercise professional to identify safe and effective exercises to be incorporated into the client&rsquo;s program.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Two commonly seen postural distortion patterns are upper cross syndrome and lower cross syndrome.</em></p>
<h3 id="upper-cross-syndrome">Upper Cross Syndrome<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#upper-cross-syndrome">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Upper Cross Syndrome</strong> (also known as <strong>Rounded Shoulder Syndrome</strong>)</p>
<ul>
<li>forward head position</li>
<li>protracted and elevated scapula</li>
<li>increased kyphosis</li>
<li>forward-rounded shoulders</li>
</ul>
<p>This postural deviation is typical of sedentary individuals and those who spend a great deal of time sitting at a desk, but can also result from overemphasis of one muscle group in training (e.g., chest), compensation due to injury, or even emotional distress.</p>
<p><em><strong>Upper cross syndrome typically involves functionally tight or overactive muscles as well as weak or inhibited muscles.</strong></em></p>
<p>This is physiologically explained through a neuromuscular concept called:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Reciprocal Inhibition</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>a tight, overactive agonist muscle will decrease or inhibit the neurological activation of its antagonist muscle, which results in functional weakness of this antagonist</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put simply, muscles that are shortened are over-stimulated by the nervous system and become dominant, whereas muscles that are lengthened are under stimulated by the nervous system and become weak or passive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As such, upper cross syndrome typically involves functionally tight or overactive muscles as well as weak or inhibited muscles.</em></p>

<p>For example, a personal trainer observed a client&rsquo;s knees adduct inward into a valgus position while performing a body weight squat.</p>
<ul>
<li>This may suggest the client&rsquo;s hip adductor muscle group may be tight or overactive.</li>
<li>In addition, the client&rsquo;s gluteus medius may be weak or underactive.</li>
<li>Therefore, as part of the client&rsquo;s program, the personal trainer should include a static stretch or self-myofascial release using a foam roller for the hip adductors, and a resistance exercise, such as standing hip abduction with a resistance band, to activate and strengthen the gluteus medius muscles.</li>

<p>The health-related components of physical fitness include:</p>
<ul>
<li>body composition</li>
<li>cardiorespiratory endurance</li>
<li>muscular strength</li>
<li>muscular endurance</li>
<li>flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p>The final section of this module will review fitness assessment protocols commonly used by personal trainers to obtain measurements for each of these components of fitness.</p>
<h2 id="body-composition">Body Composition<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#body-composition">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Body Composition</strong> is defined as <em>the relative amount of fat mass and lean body mass throughout the body and is expressed as a percent of body fat (%BF)</em>.</p>
<p>Body composition may be measured or estimated using a number of different techniques of which skinfold measurements obtained using a caliper offer the most practical alternative for most exercise professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Skinfold Technique</strong> is based upon the assumption that the amount of subcutaneous fat (located under the skin) is proportional to the total body fat, with approximately one-third of the total fat located subcutaneously; however, the exact proportion does vary by age, gender, and race.</p>
<ul>
<li>By measuring the subcutaneous fat using skinfold calipers, the individual&rsquo;s percent of body fat may be estimated using appropriate regression equations.</li>
<li>This method can be quite accurate in comparison to the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; of hydrostatic weighing; however, it is highly dependent upon the skill and experience of the test administrator as well as the selection of population-specific protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>To ensure a valid and reliable estimation of body composition, the following standardized procedures should be used when performing skinfold testing:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>All measurements should be made on the right side of the body with the subject standing upright</em></li>
<li>Caliper should be placed directly on the skin surface, 1 cm away from the thumb and finger, perpendicular to the skinfold, and halfway between the crest and base of the fold</li>
<li>Pinch should be maintained while reading the caliper</li>
<li>Wait 1-2 seconds (not longer) before reading the caliper</li>
<li>Take duplicate measurements at each site and retest if the duplicate measurements are not within 1 to 2 mm</li>
<li>Rotate through skinfold sites or allow time for the skin to regain normal texture and thickness</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There are nine commonly used skinfold sites.</strong></p>
<p><em>The standardized descriptions for these skinfold sites are provided in the table:</em></p>

<p>Two frequently-used protocols including three skinfold sites have been validated for both men and women:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Men</strong>
<ul>
<li>skinfold measurements taken at the <strong>chest</strong>, <strong>abdominal</strong>, and <strong>thigh</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Women</strong>
<ul>
<li>skinfold sites include the <strong>triceps</strong>, <strong>suprailiac</strong>, and <strong>thigh</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In accordance with the standardized skinfold testing procedures, several (e.g., 2-3) measurements are obtained at each anatomical location until a consistent (i.e., within 1-2 mm) number is obtained.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The average measurement obtained at each of the three skinfold sites is totaled together.</li>
<li>The sum of the three skinfolds is then applied to a generalized skinfold equation to determine body density, which is then applied to a general or population-specific formula to convert body density to percent body fat.</li>
<li>For convenience, body fat estimation tables have been created based on these calculations.</li>
<li>Although normative data has been published, a consensus opinion for an exact percent body fat value associated with optimal health has not yet been established.</li>
<li><em>However, a range of <strong>10% to 22% for men</strong> and <strong>20% to 32% for women</strong> is generally accepted as being satisfactory.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cardiorespiratory-endurance">Cardiorespiratory Endurance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cardiorespiratory-endurance">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Cardiorespiratory Endurance</strong> is the capacity of the <strong>circulatory and respiratory systems</strong> to supply oxygen to the working muscles during continuous aerobic physical activity.</p>
<p>Cardiorespiratory endurance is an important component of a fitness evaluation since a low level of cardiorespiratory endurance has been directly correlated to a higher risk of premature death, heart disease, obesity, and many other chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>Cardiorespiratory endurance is typically represented by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximal Oxygen Consumption (VO2max)</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>the highest amount of oxygen that can be utilized by the skeletal muscles during maximal, exhaustive exercise</em></li>
<li>Relative VO2max is expressed as milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute of exercise (mL/kg/min)</li>
<li>VO2max may be measured directly through gas exchange analysis during a <strong>maximal graded exercise test (abbreviated GXT)</strong>, estimated based on physiologic response to a submaximal test protocol, or estimated based on performance during a field-test</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="graded-exercise-tests-gxt">Graded Exercise Tests (GXT)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#graded-exercise-tests-gxt">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Graded Exercise Test</strong> protocols are typically performed on a <strong>treadmill</strong> or <strong>stationary cycle</strong> during which the exercise intensity (i.e., workload) is gradually increased at set time intervals (typically 2-3 minutes) as the physiological responses such as oxygen consumption and heart rate are monitored.</p>
<p><em>As the exercise intensity increases, oxygen consumption will increase in a linear fashion</em>.</p>
<h4 id="maximal-gxts">Maximal GXTs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#maximal-gxts">#</a></h4>
<p>Maximal GXTs are performed up to the physiological maximum oxygen consumption, defined by a plateau in VO2max despite further increases to the exercise workload, or to the point of volitional fatigue.</p>
<p><em>If the subject needs to end the test due to fatigue before oxygen consumption plateaus, then it is considered a <strong>VO2peak</strong> versus VO2max.</em></p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod4/VO2max.png"/> 
</figure>

<h4 id="submaximal-gxts">Submaximal GXTs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#submaximal-gxts">#</a></h4>
<p>Submaximal GXTs are performed up to a predetermined end-point, typically 85% of age-predicted maximum heart rate.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>As the exercise intensity increases, there will be a corresponding linear increase in heart rate.</em></li>
<li>The heart rate response to this submaximal intensity is then extrapolated out to the theoretical age-predicted maximum heart rate and the corresponding theoretical maximum intensity or workload that would have been attained had the test continued to maximum exertion.</li>
<li>The subject&rsquo;s estimated VO2max can then be calculated based on the predicted maximum workload.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod4/HRmax.png"/> 
</figure>

<p><em>During both maximal and submaximal graded exercise testing, the test is also terminated if adverse cardiovascular responses are observed or of course if the subject requests to stop.</em></p>
<p><strong>Maximal Graded Exercise Tests (Maximal GXTs) provides the most accurate data.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>However, an assessment of this nature requires expensive equipment and an experienced test administrator.</li>
<li><em>In addition, maximal GXTs present more risk and may not be appropriate for many fitness participants.</em></li>
<li>Subsequently, exercise professionals often utilize appropriate field-tests to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="field-tests-for-cardiorespiratory-fitness">Field Tests for Cardiorespiratory Fitness<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#field-tests-for-cardiorespiratory-fitness">#</a></h3>
<p>Field tests to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness utilize various modes of exercise, such as walking, running, and stepping, typically performed at a submaximal intensity. Field tests may be performed in a non-laboratory setting, require only minimal equipment, are inexpensive, and are easily administered by an exercise professional.</p>
<p><em>Using a field test, a client&rsquo;s cardiorespiratory fitness may be estimated based on:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time to cover a specific distance</strong> (e.g., Rockport One-Mile Walk, Cooper 1.5 Mile Run)</li>
<li><strong>Distance covered within a specific duration of time</strong> (e.g., Cooper 12-minute Walk/Run)</li>
<li><strong>Recovery heart rate following a specific exercise workload</strong> (e.g., YMCA 3-Minute Step Test)</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific protocol selected should be appropriate based on the participant&rsquo;s goals, current level of fitness, health status, skill, and limitations.</p>

<h4 id="cooper-12-minute-walkrun-test">Cooper 12-Minute Walk/Run Test<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cooper-12-minute-walkrun-test">#</a></h4>
<p>The 12-Minute Walk/Run Test was developed by Dr. Kenneth Cooper as a method of estimating cardiorespiratory fitness based on the maximal distance covered, either walking and/or running, in 12 minutes. Similar to the one-mile walk test, this field test is a convenient and cost-effective option requiring minimal equipment or skill.</p>
<p><em>This test may be more appropriate for conditioned individuals who are accustomed to moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of the Cooper 12-Minute Walk/Run Test is to assess:</p>
<ul>
<li>cardiorespiratory fitness</li>
<li>classify fitness level</li>
<li>monitor progress with an exercise program</li>
<li>estimate VO2max</li>
</ul>
<p>Equipment needed:</p>

</ul>
<p>After explaining the purpose and procedures for the test:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow the participant a short warm-up period</li>
<li>instruct the participant to walk and/or run as far as possible in 12 minutes
<ul>
<li>the objective is to cover as much distance as possible within the allotted time</li>
<li>walking is permitted, but the subject should be encouraged to challenge themselves as much as possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>upon completion of 12 minutes, record the total distance covered in meters</li>

<h4 id="ymca-3-minute-step-test">YMCA 3-Minute Step Test<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ymca-3-minute-step-test">#</a></h4>
<p>The YMCA 3-Minute Step Test may be used to categorize an individual&rsquo;s level of cardiorespiratory fitness based on recovery heart rate following this standardized step test.</p>
<p>The YMCA step test uses a 12 inch step with a stepping rate of 24 step cycles per minute (96 foot contacts per minute), which is equivalent to an oxygen consumption of 25.8 mL/kg/min.</p>
<p><em>This test is appropriate for nearly all populations, although caution is warranted for those with knee and balance issues.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of the YMCA 3-Minute Step Test is to assess:</p>
<ul>
<li>cardiorespiratory fitness</li>
<li>progress with fitness program</li>
</ul>
<p>Equipment needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>stopwatch</li>
<li>a metronome</li>
<li>a 12-inch step</li>
</ul>
<p>After explaining the purpose and procedures for the test:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow the participant to briefly practice proper stepping cadence with the metronome set to 96 beats per minute (24 step cycles per minute)</li>
<li>once acclimated, the participant is ready to begin the test</li>
<li>instruct the participant to step for three minutes keeping pace with the metronome</li>
<li>alert the participant when one minute has elapsed, and again when one minute is remaining</li>
<li>upon conclusion of three minutes of stepping, the participant immediately sits down and recovery heart rate is counted for a full minute, with the count starting within 5 seconds at the end of the stepping</li>
</ul>
<p>The recovery heart rate value is used to obtain a qualitative rating of cardiorespiratory fitness using published normative tables.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>A lower recovery heart rate is indicative of a higher level of cardiorespiratory fitness.</em></li>
<li>Since some blood pressure medications, such as beta-blockers, may suppress heart rate response to exercise, this assessment will not be a valid indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness for some individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several other step test protocols have also been developed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The various protocols may differ with regard to step height, stepping cadence, and/or duration of recovery heart rate.</li>
<li>Exercise professionals are encouraged to select a mode of exercise and assessment protocol that is appropriate for the needs, abilities, and programming objectives of each individual client.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="muscular-strength">Muscular Strength<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#muscular-strength">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Muscular strength</strong> is defined as <em>the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to exert a maximum force against an external load.</em></p>
<p>Muscular strength may be assessed and quantified using a <strong>One-Repetition Maximum (1RM)</strong> test performed on a specific exercise, such as a bench press or barbell squat.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Following an appropriate warm-up period, this method involves several sets of a specific exercise using progressively heavier workloads, with each set separated by a rest period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through trial-and-error, resistance is added for each subsequent set until the maximal amount of weight that can be lifted for a single repetition through a full range of motion with good form and technique is determined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since lifting a maximal workload is necessary, this method of testing dynamic muscular strength <em>does present a higher risk for musculoskeletal injury</em>, particularly when working with novice or deconditioned subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, muscular strength may be predicted from a <strong>submaximal workload</strong>, <em>which is lifted for a multiple repetition maximum, ideally 10-RM or less.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using this method, predicted maximal strength is based on the inverse linear relationship between resistance lifted and repetitions performed, such that as the resistance increases, the maximal number of repetitions performed decreases and vice versa.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="predicted-1-rm">Predicted 1-RM<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#predicted-1-rm">#</a></h3>
<p>Several formula&rsquo;s have been developed to estimate one-repetition maximum based on a submaximal weight lifted for several repetitions to fatigue. Among these formula&rsquo;s is the <strong>Brzycki Equation:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Predicted 1-RM = Weight Lifted / 1.0278 - (0.0278 x reps to fatigue)</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>To predict one-repetition maximum using this equation, <strong>select a submaximal resistance that will elicit fatigue within 10 or less repetitions</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter the weight lifted and the number of repetitions performed to fatigue into the equation, and complete the calculations.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if client was able to complete 7 repetitions to maximum effort on the bench press with 160 pounds, then the client&rsquo;s estimated one-repetition maximum (1-RM) on the bench press is 192 pounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Predicted 1-RM = Weight Lifted / 1.0278 - (0.0278 x reps to fatigue)</em></li>
<li>Predicted 1-RM = 160 lb / 1.0278 - (0.0278 x <em>7 reps</em>)</li>
<li>Predicted 1-RM = 192 lb</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note, candidates will not be expected to perform estimated 1-repetition maximum calculations of this nature on the certification exam. However, candidates should be able to generally categorize or recognize a participant&rsquo;s relative level of muscular strength based on assessments of this type.</em></p>
<p>The table provided was developed from the Brzycki Equation and may be used for quick reference of predicted 1-repetition maximum without completing calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the info from the example provided, the intersection of 7 repetitions and 160 pounds indicates an estimated 1-RM of 192 pounds.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod4/1RM.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>The Brzycki Equation has been validated on the bench press for sedentary or moderately-active young adult men.</li>
<li>Although the use of this equation with other exercises and/or subject groups may yield less valid predictions of muscular strength, the estimations provided by this equation may allow for objective tracking of muscular strength development.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="muscular-endurance">Muscular Endurance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#muscular-endurance">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Muscular endurance</strong> is defined as <em>the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to repeatedly exert submaximal force against a resistance over a period of time</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscular endurance is typically assessed by having a participant perform as many repetitions as possible against a submaximal resistance or their own body weight.</li>
<li>Many protocols used to assess muscular endurance involve <strong>calisthenic-type exercises</strong> such as push-ups, curl-ups, or pull-ups.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="push-up-test">Push-Up Test<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#push-up-test">#</a></h3>
<p>The push-up test is a commonly used field test to assess <strong>upper body muscular endurance</strong>.</p>
<p>The push-up test is suitable for most populations with some considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Safe execution of the push-up test does require adequate shoulder complex and core stabilization. However, this test may serve a secondary objective to provide insight into the subject&rsquo;s ability to stabilize the shoulder complex and core. The push-up test may be contraindicated for those with pre-existing shoulder injuries, wrist injuries, or other orthopedic limitations.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>When performing the push-up test, men are typically in the full-body position, whereas women are typically in the modified position on their knees</li>
<li>In either position, the hands are placed approximately shoulder-width apart and the anterior core muscles are engaged to maintain neutral hip and pelvic alignment</li>
<li>The subject lowers body to 90 degrees of elbow flexion, then pushes up to the starting position with elbows fully extended</li>
<li>The subject is instructed to perform the maximum number of repetitions possible with good form and technique</li>
<li>Based on the maximum number of push-ups completed, the subject&rsquo;s muscular endurance may be classified using published normative tables</li>
<li>Individual progress may be monitored comparing future re-assessment results to the baseline number of push-ups performed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="partial-curl-up-test">Partial Curl-Up Test<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#partial-curl-up-test">#</a></h3>
<p>The partial curl-up test may be used to <strong>assess abdominal muscular endurance</strong>.</p>
<p>Generally, this assessment is well-tolerated by most individuals. <em>However, care should be used with those having low back and neck injuries</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to the protocol presented, several other variations of the partial curl-up test have also been developed.</p>
<p>Prior to the test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark off two sets of masking tape lines, one for left hand and one for right hand, approximately six inches long and 8 cm apart</li>
<li>Set a metronome to 40 beats/min so the curl-ups are performed at a rate of 1 curl-up every 3 seconds or 20 per minute</li>
</ul>
<p>Performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject lies in the supine hook-lying position with knees bent at 90 degrees and feet flat on floor</li>
<li>The subject begins with finger tips on the closest piece of masking tape and flexes the torso to ‘curl up' until the finger tips reach the second piece of tape</li>
<li>The subject then returns to the starting position until the finger tips return to the first piece of tape</li>
<li>The curl-up cadence is such that the finger tips slide to touch the first or second piece of tape with each beat of the metronome</li>
<li>The subject continues without pausing until he or she can no longer perform the curl-ups at the rate established by the metronome and/or loses form, up to a maximum of 75 curl-ups</li>
<li>The total number of curl-ups completed can be applied to published age- and gender-specific norms to classify the subject&rsquo;s abdominal muscle endurance</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#flexibility">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong> is defined as the ability to move through a full, pain-free, range of motion.</p>
<p>Clinical Assessments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a <em>goniometer</em> or <em>inclinometer</em>, flexibility may be <em>objectively measured in degrees during a specific movement</em>, such as flexion or extension, around a joint</li>
<li>Precise range of motion measurements of this nature are typical of <em>clinical settings</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Fitness Assessments:</p>
<ul>
<li>In fitness settings, flexibility is more commonly <strong>measured in inches or centimeters during linear movement</strong> of a body part or series of body segments</li>
<li>Although these field tests of flexibility may be limited by precision of measurement and the inability to discern range of motion deficits at specific joints, they do provide a general indication of flexibility and functional movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as measurements of muscular strength and endurance are specific to a muscle or group of muscles, <strong>flexibility is joint and movement specific</strong>. As such a single test to evaluate total body flexibility does not exist.</p>
<h3 id="sit-and-reach-test">Sit-and-Reach Test<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sit-and-reach-test">#</a></h3>
<p>The sit-and-reach test is commonly-used to <strong>assess flexibility of the hamstrings, posterior hips, and low back during flexion of the torso</strong>.</p>
<p>Although this assessment is generally safe for most populations, <em>it may be inappropriate for those with low back injury or orthopedic limitations at the hip.</em></p>
<p>It is preferable to administer this assessment using a sit-and-reach box, but modified protocols have been developed using other measurement tools such as a yard stick placed on the floor:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject should complete a short cardiorespiratory warm-up prior to performing this test</li>
<li>After removing their shoes, the subject sits with the heels of the feet flat against the sit-and-reach box, corresponding to the 15-inch mark</li>
<li>The inner edges of the heels should be 6 inches apart</li>
<li>Instruct the subject to slowly reach forward sliding both hands as far as possible along the ruler while flexing the torso, holding the greatest distance attained for 2 seconds</li>
<li>The subject&rsquo;s hands are to be kept one on top of the other, without leading with one hand or bouncing</li>
<li>The fingertips should be in contact with the ruler on top the box at all times</li>
<li>The knees should remain extended (i.e., straight), but not pressed down by the test administrator</li>
<li>The subject&rsquo;s score is the most distant point reached with the fingertips</li>
<li>Record the best of three consecutive trials</li>
<li>The subject&rsquo;s flexibility may be classified using published age- and gender- specific normative tables</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="tips-for-fitness-assessments">Tips for Fitness Assessments<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tips-for-fitness-assessments">#</a></h1>
<p>The final section of this module offers some tips for the administration and interpretation of fitness assessments.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Practice and Prepare</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The time to learn how to perform an assessment is not with your client in front of you</li>
<li>Practice assessments with co-workers, friends, or family to perfect your skills before assessing clients</li>
<li>Not only will it increase your credibility and professionalism, but it will also ensure valid and reliable assessment results for your client</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Set the Stage</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Take the time to prepare the assessment environment and the equipment before your client arrives</li>
<li>Make sure the assessment room or space is large enough to accommodate the planned assessments</li>
<li>Check the equipment to ensure it&rsquo;s in good working order and properly calibrated when necessary</li>
<li>Plan for an appropriate level of privacy when conducting assessments with your clients</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Pick Proper Protocols</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Although certain health screening and fitness assessment protocols should be routinely performed with all clients, others should be individually selected based on the goals, needs, and limitations of the specific client</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Create Consistency</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>To ensure reliable pre- and post-assessment comparisons, it&rsquo;s important to be consistent in terms of protocol, standardized procedures, equipment, testing sequence, pre-test instructions, and environment</li>
<li>It may not be possible to replicate the exact same conditions every time, but greater consistency ensures greater reliability of measurements</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Emphasize the Individual</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Normative data is readily available for most fitness assessments; however, it&rsquo;s important to understand what motivates your client</li>
<li>Some may thrive on comparisons to others and being the “best,” while others may find it discouraging, particularly when fitness levels are below average or low</li>
<li>Focus interpretation of data and goal-setting on individual improvements in personal health and fitness, rather than competing with others</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Explore the Options</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This module barely skims the surface of existing assessment protocols</li>
<li>Many other fitness assessment options have been established and validated</li>
<li>Take the time to familiarize yourself with other protocols including those that go beyond fitness assessment and into other dimensions of performance such as speed, power, agility, and balance</li>
</ul>
