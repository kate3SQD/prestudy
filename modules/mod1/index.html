  "articleBody": "Section 1 - The Role of the Personal Trainer Section one of the first module provides a broad overview of the role of a personal trainer.\nThis section will outline:\n the major tasks of a personal trainer the requisite knowledge associated with these tasks NETA’s Professional Code of Ethics continuing education requirements for NETA-Certified Personal Trainers the factors to consider when evaluating the credibility of health and fitness information  Tasks and Knowledge Statements As defined in the NETA Certification Board’s Exam Candidate Handbook:\n “Personal trainers are fitness professionals who promote health. They accomplish this by developing and implementing exercise programs designed to safely and effectively meet the unique goals of the clients they serve. This practice takes place in the context of their unwavering commitment to client safety and service and their adherence to the highest principles of ethical behavior.”\n Professionally-certified Personal Trainers perform a wide variety of tasks, each of which requires the acquisition of underlying knowledge and skill in order to safely and effectively perform each task.\nMajor Tasks What are the major tasks performed by a personal trainer?\nNETA’s Personal Trainer practice analysis outlines 24 task statements related to the role of a personal trainer.\nSome examples of tasks commonly performed by personal trainers include:\n Establish rapport and build professional relationships with clients Perform initial consultations with prospective clients to discuss desired health and fitness outcomes Conduct health screening and fitness assessments to gather objective data about the client’s current health, risk factors, and current level of physical fitness Define, establish, and clarify safe and realistic goals Select exercises, physical activities, and acute training variables to achieve the established goals Provide ongoing instruction and feedback to the client on execution of selected exercises, while minimizing health and safety risks Monitor and evaluate ongoing progress toward a client’s goals Utilize effective communication and coaching skills Maintain a safe physical environment for clients  NETA-certified Personal Trainers must perform their duties and responsibilities in a manner consistent with the NETA Code of Ethics.\nRequired Knowledge and/or Skills A series of Knowledge statements are listed for each of the 24 task statements included on NETA’s Personal Training practice analysis. In total, there are 36 unique knowledge statements included throughout the Personal Training practice analysis.\nWhat knowledge and/or skills does a personal trainer need to perform these tasks?\nTo perform these tasks a personal trainer must have knowledge of:\n Active listening techniques and coaching methods Theoretical models of behavioral change Types of goals and goal-setting strategies Preparticipation screening recommendations and risk factors for disease Health screening and fitness assessment protocols Exercise-related anatomy, kinesiology, biomechanics and physiology Safe and effective exercise technique Principles of exercise training and guidelines for exercise program design Activity- and exercise-specific benefits, indications, contraindications, and risks Basic principles of nutrition and dietary guidelines Principles and guidelines for safe and effective weight management Legal considerations, risk management, and scope of practice NETA’s Professional Code of Ethics  These represent some, but not all, of the 36 knowledge statements on NETA’s Personal Trainer practice analysis.\nProfessional Code of Ethics The overarching purpose of a professional certification is to protect the public, both to ensure that Certified Personal Trainers are minimally competent to deliver safe and effective fitness services, but also to provide some reassurance that NETA-Certified Personal Trainers will conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner.\nNETA-Certified Professionals must be familiar with and abide by NETA’s Professional Code of Ethics. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action and possible revocation of certifications issued by NETA.\nIn accordance with NETA’s Professional Code of Ethics, NETA-Certified Professionals must:\n Respect the rights, welfare, privacy, and dignity of clients, co-workers, and the public at large. Provide and maintain a safe and effective training environment and exercise programming. Provide equal, fair, and reasonable treatment for all individuals. Comply with all applicable laws governing business practices, employment, and property usage. Comply with all applicable laws governing business practices, employment, and property usage. Respect and maintain the confidentiality of all client information. Maintain appropriate documentation (e.g., informed consent, PAR-Q, health \u0026 lifestyle questionnaire, progress notes, training logs, etc.). Recognize and abide by the recognized scope of practice consistent with exercise certification(s) held; avoid actions or behaviors restricted to the scope practice for adjacent health care professionals. Do not diagnose illness, injury, or medical conditions; refer clients to a more qualified health, fitness, or medical professional when appropriate. Strive to remain up-to-date with current practical and theoretical fitness/health research through continuing education, conferences, home studies, and networking with other fitness professionals. Maintain a current appropriate first-responder emergency certification. Personal trainers must maintain a valid adult CPR/AED Certification. CPR/AED certification must include a hands-on practical skills evaluation. Establish and practice clear professional boundaries. Avoid engaging with any behavior or conduct that could be construed as a conflict of interest or reflects adversely on the fitness profession, NETA, or on the NETA-CB. Represent credentials and certifications in an honest, accurate, and appropriate manner. Strive to protect the public from those who misrepresent the health and fitness professions or are in direct violation of this code of ethics by communicating concerns with the NETA-CB.  Continuing Education Passing a certification exam demonstrates to the public, employers, and other stakeholders that the certificant possess at least minimum competence and knowledge to deliver fitness services as a personal trainer. However, gaining expertise and becoming truly skilled as a personal trainer requires many years of high quality experience and continuing education. Earning NETA’s Personal Trainer certification is just the beginning of this educational journey. Similar to credentials earned in other adjacent health fields and professions, all NCCA-accredited fitness certifications require continuing education to maintain the credential.\nNETA’s Personal Trainer Certification is valid for two years from the date of issue.\n To renew a NETA Personal Trainer Certification, the certificant must earn a minimum of twenty (20) continuing education credits (CECs) during the two-year period between the certification’s date of issue and the designated expiration date. Continuing education credits may be earned by attending live events such as workshops or conferences, or by completing home study courses.  For more information regarding recertification requirements, please refer to NETA’s website and/or the NETA Certification Board’s Recertification Handbook.\nScientific research, industry standards, programming guidelines, and best-practices are constantly evolving in the fitness industry. It is important that NETA-Certified Personal Trainers take responsibility to stay well-informed of these changes and advancements.\nIdentifying Credible Sources of Information It can be very challenging for both consumers and exercise professionals to navigate the endless volumes of health and fitness information that is readily available at the click of a mouse. Social media, self-proclaimed expert bloggers, internet websites, and consumer-oriented magazines offer advice and ‘ground-breaking' scientific evidence regarding the best approaches to loss weight, increase fitness, and improve health. The information is often conflicting and confusing.\nHow can an exercise professional determine if information is credible and reliable?\nHere are some questions to ask yourself when evaluating sources of health and fitness information:\nWhat is the source of this information?\n What type company or organization (e.g., nonprofit organization, government agency, for-profit business, educational institution) is disseminating this information? Frequently, website addresses ending in “.edu,” “.gov,” or “.org” are known and reputable organizations or institutions. Be cautious of sites that have an address ending in “.com” as they are commercial sites and may be selling a product or service.  Has the content or information been verified or undergone an expert panel or peer review process?\n Reputable scientific journals and industry publications utilize a panel or an editorial board comprised of recognized experts who review and evaluate articles prior to acceptance for publication. The peer review process provides some reassurance of academic quality and validity of information or research.  What are the author’s credentials or qualifications?\n Are the author’s credentials clearly provided? Are the author’s education, background, and expertise consistent with the subject matter being presented? Does the author provide contact information? Does the author have any obvious conflicts of interest? Be leery of self-proclaimed experts who lack the requisite academic background, credentials, and professional experience.  Does the author provide appropriate references?\n Is the underlying source of information considered credible? Have other reputable authors or organizations referenced this information? Is the author accurately presenting the referenced information? Take some extra time to check into the references.  Is this information consistent with known facts or information obtained from other reputable sources?\n Is the author providing the information in a biased manner or presenting facts out of context? Does the information seem plausible? New scientific research may challenge long-held beliefs and even change a paradigm, but be skeptical if one source of information conflicts with the general consensus.  When was the information published or last updated?\n Is the information current or perhaps outdated? Do the references site current research or is it years or perhaps decades old? The information may be outdated.   Section 2: Communication \u0026 Relationship Building Section two of this module reviews communication skills and relationship building.\nTopics covered include:\n making a positive first impression establishing rapport interpreting body language questioning, reflecting, and other active listening skills  Making a Positive First Impression The initial reaction and first impressions formed during an encounter with another person have a lasting effect on the development of a relationship, or lack thereof, between two people. These first impressions are made quickly, often during the initial moments of a conversation or even through observations made prior to any verbal communication.\n7-11 Rule of First Impressions suggests that people make eleven decisions about you within the first seven seconds of an initial interaction.\n These eleven decisions include:  are you friendly attractive knowledgeable professional empathetic credible confident clean helpful courteous responsive    Researchers have also suggested that within 10 milliseconds of seeing a stranger’s face, people make five trait judgments regarding an individual’s:\n attractiveness likeability trustworthiness competence aggressiveness  In addition, researchers have theorized that we analyze our first impressions of another person in an effort to predict the likelihood that future contact with this person will bring us personal rewards and positive outcomes.\n Based on these first impressions, we proceed to develop relationships with those we expect to be most rewarding and we limit or restrict interaction with those who appear to have fewer benefits to offer.  Whether you realize it or not, you are being watched. Potential clients, class participants, and club members make countless decisions and judgments about you, often even before an actual interaction.\n People are casually assessing your attitude, demeanor, professionalism, and competence, among many other attributes. Their assessment will often determine whether or not they will initiate or reciprocate a conversation with you.  So, how can you make a positive first impression?\nThe following strategies may help to create a positive first impression:\n Dress for success and look like a true professional  Wear appropriately-fitted and clean clothes (e.g., club-logo’ed apparel, shirt tucked in, looking sharp)   Attend to your personal hygiene  Make sure you are well-groomed, with fresh breath, and minimize the use of heavy fragrances   Be attentive to your clients needs and other members in the club  When working with a client or club member, stay engaged Keep your focus on the individual with whom you are working   Monitor your body language  Be aware of the messages you send, both positive and negative, through your posture, body position, facial expressions, and use of physical cues   Smile  An authentic smile often receives a smile in return Smiling is a simple way to make a positive first impression   Start with a professional greeting  When meeting someone remember to smile, make eye contact, shake hands with confidence and respect, introduce yourself first, and engage the other person in casual conversation   Listen carefully to others  Listening is among the best conversational strategies to make a positive first impression and to establish rapport with others The less you talk, the greater your opportunity to get to know the real person standing (or sitting) in front of you   Speak clearly  Use non-technical language when possible Communicate with confidence, clearly articulate words, and ask thoughtful questions   And last, follow the ‘golden rule', treat others as you would like to be treated  Building Relationships: Rapport The first step toward building a meaningful relationship with another person is to establish rapport.\nRapport may be simply defined as a positive interaction or connection experienced between two people.\nIt has been proposed that rapport is created through the interrelation of three components including mutual attentiveness, positivity, and coordination:\n Mutual attentiveness is displayed through a shared expression of interest with one another Positivity is seen as the reciprocation of friendliness and caring during an interaction Coordination can also be thought of as harmony or balance between two individuals  Although some people may be particularly skilled at developing rapport, it is not an inherent personality trait, but rather an experience that results from the combination of qualities that emerge from each individual during an interaction. This positive connection or experience may be expressed when people say they “hit it off”, “clicked”, “had good chemistry”, “were on the same page”, or “in sync”.\nEstablishing rapport is the critical first step of communication.\n Rapport leads to trust  trust leads to open communication  open communication leads to better understanding of the other person      The presence of rapport between two individuals is believed to facilitate influence and responsiveness, which is essential for fitness professionals when building relationships with club members and prospects and facilitating behavioral change for their clients.\nCertainly, if rapport is established with another person, then that individual is more inclined to like, trust, and respect you, which increases the probability that they may want to utilize your fitness services.\nIn short, rapport is about getting people to like you….\nMaking People Like You In his best selling book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, Dale Carnegie introduces six ways to make people like you:\n First, become genuinely interested in other people   As Carnegie notes, “You can make more friends in 2 weeks by taking interest in other people than you can make in 2 months trying to get others to take interest in you”  Smile   One of the best ways to make a positive first impression A genuine smile is often reflected with another smile  Remember people’s names   Carry a pocket notebook when you are working in the fitness center After you meet someone, write down their name, a brief description, and any noteworthy characteristics or topics of conversation Refer to your name book to remember those you meet  Be a good listener   The most important communication skill is listening The more you listen, the more you learn about the other person…and the more they enjoy talking with you since you are taking interest in their favorite topic: them  Talk in terms of the other person’s interests   Keep the ‘spotlight' on the other person It’s not about you, it’s all about them  Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely   One of the deepest human needs is the desire to feel important Satisfy this need and others will be naturally attracted to your company  Approaching Members Perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing personal trainers is acquiring and retaining clients.\n For some, connecting with people, developing relationships, and obtaining clients may seem effortless. However, the success of many personal trainers is limited by fear of rejection, self-doubt, or poor communication skills all of which stifle attempts to build their clientele. To establish yourself as a successful trainer, it is important to proactively approach members in the fitness center, making connections with potential clients. Creating visibility and connecting with members (i.e., prospects for your personal training services) is an important strategy to build your clientele. However, the manner in which exercise professionals approach members will have a significant influence on the trajectory of their relationships.  The Wrong Way Avoid approaching members with questions that may be perceived as judgmental, condescending, or may question their competency.\n For example:  “Can I make a suggestion?” “…recommend a better way of doing that?” “…show you a different technique?” “…help you with that exercise?” “…show you the right way to do that?”    Although you have good intentions to help, you may be unknowingly insulting the member or causing them to feel embarrassed. This is generally not an effective approach to establish rapport.\nAlthough some may accept your advice, many others may react negatively. In fact, many people have a conditioned response to decline an offer of assistance, similar to the way one may respond to a salesperson who asks, “Can I help you find something?” Without giving it much thought many will automatically reply, “No thanks, I’m just looking.” Although a member or prospect may turn you down using different words, when they respond to your close-ended question with a “No,” it is very difficult for you to move forward creating a positive connection with that person. An opportunity lost!\nThe Right Way The first interaction with a member or prospect must be professional, pleasant, and most important, non-threatening.\n“Greet-and-Go” is a brief interaction that allows you to make contact with the member, to introduce yourself, and let them know you are available without placing any pressure on them or giving them the opportunity to respond, “No”.\n Introduce yourself by name Compliment something specific Let them know you are available to enrich their experience in your facility Ask for their name Leave them alone  The Goal The goal of your first interaction with a member is not to correct a mistake, offer unsolicited advice, or attempt to educate.\nYour goal is simply to establish a positive connection with the member, to learn their name, and to let them know who you are.\nYou are just breaking the ice for future interactions. You will have other opportunities to gather more information and eventually to provide instruction as necessary.\n First you want them to like you and to trust you. Immediately after this initial interaction, write the member’s name down in your name book (i.e., a pocket notebook). Also include a brief description of the member and any other noteworthy characteristics or topics from the conversation. Use this for future reference to help you remember members' names.  Note: If the member is doing something that is an IMMEDIATE danger for either themselves or the people around them, then you MUST intervene. The objective in this case is safety.\nIf the member is performing a questionable exercise or doing something in a less than ideal manner (i.e., not likely to present an immediate danger), then connect with them first, correct them later.\nThe Impact of a Message: Body Language The word communication originates from the Latin word “communis”, meaning to share or to make common.\nCommunication is the act of conveying and receiving information through the exchange of messages delivered by speech, visual aids, signals, writing, body language, or behavior.\nThe information you deliver to and receive from another individual is represented by both verbal and nonverbal messages:\n Verbal messages include both the words you speak and how you express these words  It is has been estimated that only 7% of the message you send or receive is communicated by what you say (verbal message) An additional 38% of the message is conveyed by how you say the words (paraverbal message)  This includes elements such as your tone of voice, pronunciation, speaking rate, and vocal projection     Nonverbal communication which includes body language, facial expressions, gestures, posture, and movements of the head is the final 55% of the message  Although these percentages are commonly referenced, it is likely that the relative importance of words, tonality, and body language is dependent on the context of the communication (e.g., phone conversations).\n  Interpreting Body Language Observing and correctly interpreting the body language of another person is a nonverbal communication skill.\nBody language may include any number of conscious or unconscious movements of the body used to communicate a message to another person.\n These methods of communication may include facial expressions, eye contact, head and body position, posture, and gestures. These often hidden messages delivered through nonverbal cues both compliment and at times contradict the spoken word. In addition to delivering a message, these cues may also reflect attitudes and feelings.  Since the messages delivered through body language play such a crucial role in communication, it’s important for the fitness professional to recognize, interpret, and understand these nonverbal signals.\nWhat does it mean?…\n Arms crossed:  Holding the arms folded across the chest is a defensive closed position, suggesting an unwillingness to communicate or disagreement with the statement or opinion of the person   Hand over mouth:  Holding the hand in front of the mouth may suggest the individual is not being truthful and is trying to hide their words or cover the lie   Rubbing side of nose:  Touching or lightly rubbing the side of the nose may suggest disbelief, doubt, deception, or that the person is being untruthful   Finger tapping:  Tapping the fingers may indicate that the person is growing impatient or may signal boredom   Touching the chin:  Touching or stroking the chin may indicate the person is processing information or their thoughts, or making a decision    Active Listening Skills Active listening is a communication skill based on the work of psychologist Carl Rogers.\nActive listening helps to build rapport, trust, and understanding. Verbal active listening skills convey to the speaker that you are paying attention and comprehending their message.\nSome common verbal active listening skills include questioning, repeating, paraphrasing, reflecting, clarifying, summarizing, and the use of minimal encouragers:\n Questioning  Allows us to gather information using both open- and closed-ended questions By asking thoughtful and relevant questions the listener also helps to reinforce that they have an interest in what the speaker has to say   Repeating  Simply restating or parroting a message using exactly the same words as used by the speaker Repeating or parroting should be used sparingly in normal conversation   Paraphrasing  A restatement of a message that retains the original meaning, but using similar yet different words to achieve greater clarity   Reflecting  Closely repeating or paraphrasing what the speaker has said in order to demonstrate or gain understanding In addition to reflecting the content of the spoken message, reflective statements also allow the listener to convey a guess regarding the meaning of a statement or underlying feelings and emotions of the speaker   Clarifying  Often involves asking follow-up questions to confirm understanding of the message, or to gather additional information   A summary statement  Brings together the facts or multiple pieces of information to check understanding Summarizing involves taking the main points of a message or conversation and reiterating them in a logical and clear manner, giving the speaker an opportunity to correct if necessary   Minimal encouragers  Brief, positive prompts such as words, phrases, or even non-verbal head nods to keep the conversation going and to show you are listening    Asking Questions Questioning is an active listening skill used to collect information. There are two general categories of questions: closed-ended and open-ended.\nThoughtful and relevant questions also help to reinforce that the listener is engaged and interested in what the speak has to say.\nClosed-Ended Questions\n Call for a short answer and limit the individual’s response options Many closed-ended questions are answered with either a yes or no  For example, “Do you smoke?”   Closed-ended questions may also collect a specific piece of information  For example, “How many days per week do you exercise?”   Some closed-ended questions may feel like multiple choice questions  For example, “Which of the following pieces of cardiorespiratory equipment do you enjoy the most, treadmill, elliptical trainer, or bike?”   Generally speaking, closed-ended questions tend to seek factual information  Open-Ended Questions\n Invite the individual to provide a more elaborate response Open-ended questions offer the respondent a great deal of freedom in their reply Open-ended questions often begin with “what” or “how,” and are used to explore someone’s thoughts, feelings, and opinions  For example, “What do you enjoy about exercise?” or “How will your life be different when you reach your target weight?”   Other times, an open-ended question may take the form of an indirect question presented as a statement  For example, “Tell me about your current exercise program.”   Open-ended questions may also begin with “Why”; however, “why” questions should be used with caution since questions of this nature may feel judgmental, evoke defensiveness, or result in an unproductive “I don’t know” reply  Asking open-ended questions is a fundamental skill used in motivational interviewing, which will be presented in the next section of this module.\nReflective Statements Reflective statements help the listener to confirm understanding of the speaker’s message and allow the listener to convey a guess regarding the meaning of a statement or underlying feelings and emotions of the speaker.\nReflections allow the speaker to hear their own words, to see things from a different perspective, and to better understand the meaning behind their own statements.\nReflective statements are an important active listening skill and are utilized extensively with motivational interviewing as presented in the next section.\nThere are many different types of reflective statements:\nSimple Reflection\n Paraphrases and restates the speaker’s message, utilizing their own words without exaggeration, interpretation, or distortion For example, if a client states, “I have been so busy with work and family that I just don’t have time to exercise,” then the personal trainer may reply with a simple reflection such as, “I hear you saying that you don’t have time to exercise due to your busy schedule of work and family obligations.”  Complex Reflection\n Adds some meaning or emphasis to what the speaker has stated, making a guess about the unspoken message or what might be coming next A complex reflection in response to the same client statement seen above may be, “So you would like to take time to exercise, but you are just too busy and overwhelmed with work and family obligations.” Although the client has not stated a desire to exercise, the trainer’s reflection adds the suggestion that the client would like to exercise, if their schedule would permit  Amplified Reflection\n Moves a statement to one extreme, maximizing or minimizing what the speaker has said with hope of evoking disagreement from the speaker in the direction of change talk, which is a statement in favor of a desired behavior Again, in response to the same client statement, the trainer may reply with an amplified reflection like, “So, I hear you saying that it’s absolutely impossible for you to make time for exercise in your schedule.” A reflection of this nature may prompt the client to realize it is not absolutely impossible, but rather there are some options that would allow time for exercise  Double-Sided Reflection\n Acknowledges the speaker’s ambivalence toward change by restating points both in favor or against making a change For example, the trainer states, “It sounds like you are just too busy to fit exercise into your schedule. However, I remember you have also mentioned that exercise makes you feel better and helps to manage the stresses of your demanding schedule.”  Reflection of Feeling\n Involves expressing in one’s own words the emotions implied by the speaker A feeling reflection may also present a guess on how the speaker may be feeling Feelings can be reflected from both verbal and nonverbal messages from the speaker Using the same client statement, the personal trainer may speculate on the client’s feeling by stating, “So you are feeling overwhelmed by all of your commitments and frustrated that exercise has not fit into your schedule.”  Reframing Reflection\n Suggest a different meaning or perspective for what the speaker has described For example, if a client states, “Lately, my husband has really been bothering me to begin an exercise program,” the personal trainer may reframe the statement by saying, “Your husband must really care about you and would like to see you remain healthy.” This takes the negative tone of the client’s statement and reframes it in a more positive manner  Reflections are an essential skill used in motivational interviewing. An overview of motivational interviewing will be presented in the next section.\nBarriers to Listening As stated by psychologist Carl Rogers:\n “Attentive listening means giving one’s total and undivided attention to the other person and tells the other that we are interested and concerned.”\n Listening is a skill that requires focus and practice. Unfortunately, there are many barriers that can derail attentive listening.\nA common communication error made by many health and exercise professionals is simply talking too much.\n If you are dominating the conversation, talking too much, and providing information, then you are not listening or learning about the other individual. As a general rule, you should allow the other person to do most of the talking. It has been suggested that the other person should be speaking 70% of the time; where you as the listener speak 30% of the time, asking open-ended questions and using reflective statements.  Other potential listening barriers are internal distractions such as your own thoughts, feelings, and biases.\n For example, rather than truly listening to the speaker, you may be thinking about what you are going to say next or thinking about something completely off topic, like where you have to be after the meeting or what you are going to make for dinner. Feelings and emotions can also create an internal distraction from attentive listening. Feeling angry, upset, or anxious can all interfere with your ability to listen.  Listening barriers may also be external distractions such as noise in the fitness center, a cell phone vibrating in your pocket indicating a call, email, or text message, or visual distractions such as another member doing an unsafe exercise, or a TV diverting your attention.\nYour knowledge and expertise as an exercise professional may also create a potential listening barrier.\n Like other health care providers, exercise professionals may feel an obligation and a strong temptation to help others by solving their problem and disseminating expert advice. However, in doing so the personal trainer is likely to spend too much time talking and educating the client at the expense of listening, learning, and understanding the client’s situation and true needs. In addition, by prematurely offering solutions to the client’s presumed problem, it takes responsibility away from the client and disempowers them, which may decrease the likelihood the client will follow this expert advice and achieve behavioral change. Furthermore, it may cause the client to feel belittled or patronized, which may hinder rapport.  Remember, “No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care.”\n Section 3: Motivation \u0026 Behavior Change As personal trainers, we often devote much of our time and attention to exercise sciences, physiology, and the technical aspects of developing and implementing an exercise program. However, even the most scientifically sound and well-designed exercise program will be ineffective if the client will not adhere to the plan. Knowledge of psychology of exercise and behavior change is also essential to the success of a personal trainer, and of course their clients.\nSection three of this module reviews motivation and behavior change:\n types of motivation and motivators the concept of self-efficacy the transtheoretical model of behavior change goal-setting strategies motivational interviewing  Motivation Changing a behavior or adopting a new behavior, such as starting an exercise program or eating a healthier diet requires motivation. So, what is motivation?\nMotivation may be defined as the degree of determination, drive, or desire with which an individual approaches (or avoids) a behavior.\nOn the other hand, a complete lack of motivation or a desire to engage in a certain behavior or activity is known as Amotivation.\nMotivation is often categorized as either intrinsic or extrinsic:\n Intrinsic Motivation  Originates internally and refers to the motivation to perform a task for the inherent pleasure, enjoyment, satisfaction, or personal challenge Since intrinsic motivation comes from within an individual, it is also called Internal Motivation   Extrinsic Motivation  Driven by factors external to or outside of an individual such as financial incentives, awards, competition, approval from others, or recognition Since extrinsic motivation originates from outside of the individual, it is also called External Motivation       Intrinsic Extrinsic     Fun and pleasure Health outcomes   Sense of challenge Social recognition/praise   Personal improvement and achievement Tangible rewards (e.g., t-shirts, medals, trophies)   Self-fulfillment and personal gratification Insurance premium discounts and reimbursements    Motivation Continuum The various types of motivation may be plotted on a continuum:\n Amotivation at one end Intrinsic Motivation at the other end Extrinsic Motivation in the middle    At the left of the continuum, an amotivated individual lacks any desire or willingness to exercise.\nDifferent regulators of Extrinsic Motivation also fall along a continuum:\n External Regulation  Refers to extrinsic motivation driven by the desire to gain an external reward or to avoid an external punishment. This falls to the far left within extrinsic motivation, just above amotivation. For example, an individual may be motivated to exercise solely to earn a partial reimbursement of their monthly health club membership dues from their health insurance provider.   Introjected Regulation  Refers to extrinsic motivation arising from a sense of obligation or to avoid feelings of guilt. For example, an individual may begin to exercise in response to pressure from a spouse or friend, or to satisfy the advice of their health care provider.   Identified Regulation  Is motivation driven by the desire to achieve a personal goal such weight loss or improved appearance.   Integrated Regulation  Refers to motivation to engage a certain behavior in order to confirm one’s sense of self. For instance, an individual may run because they see themselves as a runner.    Intrinsic Motivation comes from within\n Exercising because it’s pleasurable, satisfying, and one simply enjoys the act of exercise.  Moving from left to right on this continuum, the probability that one will adhere to regular exercise increases, with intrinsically motivated individuals demonstrating the strongest long-term commitment to exercise.\nSummary: Amotivation -- Extrinsic Motivation -- Intrinsic Motivation - Amotivation - Extrinsic Motivation - External Regulation - Introjected Regulation - Identified Regulation - Integrated Regulation - Intrinsic Motivation  Self-Efficacy Like motivation, the presence of self-efficacy is necessary for the adoption and maintenance of regular exercise.\nSelf-efficacy is the is the extent to which an individual believes they will be successful in performing the desired behavior given the abilities they possess and the situation in which the find themselves. In other words, self-efficacy is situation-specific self-confidence.\nSelf-Efficacy Theory (SET), introduced by psychologist Albert Bandura, proposes that confidence in personal ability to carry out a behavior (e.g., physical activity/exercise) influences the direction, intensity, and persistence of that behavior.\nIn the book, Coaching for Performance, the author, John Whitmore notes:\n The single universal internal block that prevents individuals from achieving their potential is the same, and often referred to as fear of failure, lack of confidence, self-doubt, or lack of self-belief.\n Increasing self-efficacy with regard to physical activity and exercise is a critical step toward the successful adoption of a physically-active lifestyle.\nSelf-Efficacy Theory A high level of self-efficacy is especially critical during the initial phases of change.\nSelf-Efficacy influences the thoughts, feelings, and actions throughout the process of change.\n The concept of self-efficacy is central to many models and theories of behavior change. There are several factors that may either increase or decrease an individual’s self-efficacy with regard to a particular behavior such as physical activity or exercise. Having knowledge of these factors helps the exercise professional to develop strategies intended to build one’s self-efficacy toward exercise, dietary modification, or the adoption of other healthy behaviors.    Self-Efficacy Influences:\nPast Performance and Mastery Experience\n The degree of success perceived or experienced by an individual who has previously engaged in activities similar to, or the same as, the current activity will influence their self-efficacy in the present time. An individual may think to themselves, “I’ve done it before, so I can do it again.” Self-efficacy may also increase as an individual achieves short-term goals or accomplishes smaller steps toward a desired outcome. As they experience success and master an activity or task, their self-efficacy grows. Past performance and mastery experience are perhaps the factors most strongly associated to self-efficacy since these factors are based on one’s own personal experiences.  Social Modeling and Vicarious Experiences\n Observing others or reading success stories or testimonials, especially of people having similar demographics and characteristics, can increase a person’s self-efficacy related to exercise or the achievement of a specific goal such as weight loss. In this case the individual may think to themselves, “If he or she can do it, then so can I.”  Social Persuasion\n Relates to verbal or nonverbal tactics used by others in an attempt to increase a person’s self-efficacy and influence behavior. Positive feedback and encouragement from a personal trainer or fitness instructor can have a significant influence on self-efficacy and motivation to adopt a new behavior (e.g., physical activity). In many situations, people tend to raise themselves to the expectations of those who surround and influence them.  Stress Perception \u0026 Physiological/Affective States\n Reduced perceptions of stress as well as physiological and affective states also influence self-efficacy. An individual’s self-perception of his or her level of fitness is an important factor affecting self-efficacy. Feelings of pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, or rapid heart rate associated with exercise may negatively impact self-efficacy when the individual perceives these physical responses to be representative of low fitness and their inability to sustain activity. Emotional states can also exert both a positive or negative influence on self-efficacy. Negative emotions such as fear, anxiety, sadness, disappointment, or frustration, typically reduce self-efficacy; whereas, positive emotions like happiness, pride, or exhilaration will increase self-efficacy.  Transtheoretical Model Transtheoretical Model (TTM) originally emerged in the late 1970s as the result of studies and observations regarding individuals attempting to overcome addictive behaviors such as smoking.\n Since that time, this model (also referred to as the Stages of Change Model) has been applied to other types of behavioral change including the adoption of physical activity and exercise. In fact, among all models and theories of behavioral change, the transtheoretical model is perhaps the most commonly cited with regard to increasing physical activity behavior. The transtheoretical model is an important tool for developing strategies to guide individuals toward healthier behaviors.  Stages of Change According to this model, people go through distinct, predictable stages in the process of making lifestyle behavior changes.\nThe model includes five specific stages of change:\n Precontemplation   The stage in which the individual displays no intention to adopt physical activity or exercise in the near future. These individuals are not thinking about change, do not recognize a need for change, and may even discount or ignore the benefits of making a change. In some cases, individuals in the precontemplation stage may even become defensive if the need for physical activity is suggested by others. At this stage, the person is thinking, “I won’t” make this change.  Contemplation   People are considering physical activity or another lifestyle change. Individuals have not yet adopted the new behavior; however, they are starting to weigh the benefits of regular activity with the negative implications of maintaining a sedentary lifestyle. This internal process of considering the pros and cons of change is called decisional balance, which will be discussed in more detail. Individuals in the contemplation stage often feel ambivalent to change, meaning they would like to make the change, but at the same time are content staying as they are. Although thinking about it, they are not yet fully committed to making change. At this stage, the person is thinking, “I may” become physically active or begin exercising, but then again, “I may not.”  Preparation   The individual is ready to begin physical activity in the near future, usually the next 30 days, and is mentally and physically preparing for the new behavior. In this case, the individual may even be performing some sporadic and infrequent exercise or leisure-time physical activity. This stage is also characterized by preparatory actions such as setting goals, joining a health club, buying workout clothes, or scheduling a consultation with an exercise professional. In the preparation stage, the individual is thinking, “I will” began physical activity or exercise in the very near future.  Action   Clearly defined by the individual regularly performing physical activity; however, they have been engaged in this new behavior for less than 6 months. In most cases, regular physical activity is defined according to the recommendations from the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, which is a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week. In the action stage, the individual can proudly state, “I am” regularly performing physical activity.  Maintenance Stage   Attained once a habit of regular physical activity has been sustained for six months or longer.  Relapse\n Refers to a point at which an individual falls back into an old habit or terminates performance of the new behavior. Relapses are often preceded by a lapse, which is a momentary or temporary departure from the desirable behavior. For example, missing a day or perhaps a week of physical activity, then quickly returning to the regular routine. A relapse is likely to cause the individual to move back to an earlier stage of change. Although lapses are inevitable, with recognition and planning, a relapse may be avoided.  Identifying the Stage of Change Based on the definition for each stage of change in the transtheoretical model, Marcus \u0026 Forsyth established a series of brief statements that may be used by fitness professionals to identify an individual’s stage of change.\n The first two statements are “I am currently physically active”, and “I intend to become more physically active within the next 6 months.”  If the individual indicates “no” to each of these statements, then they are considered to be in the precontemplation stage. If the individual indicates “no” to the first statement, yet responds “yes” to the second statement, then they are considered to be in the contemplation stage of change. If the individual indicates “yes” to the first statement, then the second statement is not applicable. If the individual indicates “no” to the third statement, “I currently engage in regular physical activity,” then this person is most likely in the preparation stage. Although the individual is active, their level of physical activity is not considered ‘regular' as defined by the table. If the individual indicates “yes” to the first statement, then the second statement is again not applicable. If the individual indicates “yes” to the third statement, but “no” to the final statement, then they are currently in the action stage. Finally if the individual indicates “yes” to the first, the third, and the fourth statements, then they are identified as being in the maintenance stage of behavioral change.    Having now successfully identified an individual’s current stage of change, the personal trainer may proceed to develop and implement stage-specific strategies intended to facilitate movement of this individual to subsequent stages of change.\n    No Yes     1. I am currently physically active.     2. I intend to become more physically active in the next 6 months.     3. I currently engage in regular physical activity.     4. I have been regularly physically active for the past 6 months.      Note: For activity to be regular, it must add up to a total of 30 minutes or more per day and be done at least 5 days per week. For example, you could take one 30-minute walk to take three 10-minute walks for a daily total of 30 minutes.\nScoring Algorithm\n If question 1 and 2 = “No”, then you are at stage 1 (precontemplation) If question 1 = “No” and 2 = “Yes,” then you are at stage 2 (contemplation) If question 1 = “Yes” and 3 = “No”, then you are at stage 3 (preparation) If question 1 and 3 = “Yes”, and 4 = “No”, then you are at stage 4 (action) If question 1,3, and 4 = “Yes”, then you are at stage 5 (maintenance)  Moving Through the Stages of Change Decisional Balance is an internal self-assessment of the pros and cons of remaining sedentary or becoming more physically-active.\n Precontemplation Stage   The perceived cons of adopting physical activity far outweigh the pros or benefits of being active. It may also be the case that the perceived pros of remaining inactive far outweigh the perceived negative consequences or sacrifices that may be associated with adopting physical activity. In either case, the individual values maintaining their present situation more than the alternative of becoming more physically active. It is unlikely that fitness professionals will encounter many individuals who are truly in the precontemplation stage since if these individuals have joined a health club or inquired about your services, then by definition they have already moved beyond precontemplation.  Contemplation Stage   Pros and cons are equally weighed on the decisional balanced scale. Subsequently, the individual is experiencing ambivalence, the simultaneous desire to adopt physical activity yet remain inactive at the same time. These individuals are “sitting on the fence” contemplating or thinking about what they should do, if anything at all. To catalyze movement from contemplation to preparation, intervention strategies should focus on emphasizing the perceived pros and minimizing the perceived cons of physical activity and exercise. In addition, exercise professionals may consider the use of coaching skills such as motivational interviewing to help the individual recognize and resolve their feelings of ambivalence toward change.  Preparation Stage   The pros outweigh the cons on the decisional balance scale. The individual begins to take small steps toward becoming physically-active. Intervention strategies to help move the individual from preparation to action include:  Assist the client to establish SMART goals with particular emphasis on short-term, action-oriented goals. Help to develop an appropriate plan to meet their goals and consider the use of a behavioral contract. Provide positive reinforcement to acknowledge and reward progress toward being regularly-active. Continue discussions regarding how to overcome any perceived obstacles or barriers. Encourage them to create an environment, both physical and social, that supports an active lifestyle.    Action Stage   The pros continue to build and outweigh the cons on the decisional balance scale. The individual begins to experience the physical, physiological, and psychological benefits of regular physical activity and places greater value on these benefits as they become a reality. Strategies to support the individual to maintain the current physical activity behavior and move closer to the maintenance stage include:  Provide positive feedback contingent on progress toward or success with action-oriented goals. Explore different types of activities to avoid boredom and burnout. Encourage the individual to work with and even help others to become more active. Introduce self-monitoring techniques and tools such as activity logs and wearable devices to record daily activities and trends. Discuss strategies to work through lapses in physical activity behavior and to avoid relapse to a sedentary lifestyle.    Goal-Setting  You’ve got to be very careful if you don’t know where you are going, because you might not get there. - Yogi Berra\n An important step toward the adoption of regular physical activity or other positive lifestyle changes is to establish appropriate goals.\nWell-designed goals can enhance motivation, increase self-efficacy, and improve adherence to an exercise program.\nTypes of Goals Generally speaking, there are two broad categories of goals which include action-oriented and outcome-oriented goals.\nAction-Oriented Goals\n Represent a behavior, or action, that will be performed in order to achieve a desired outcome. Action-oriented goals are typically short-term in nature, and often represent an action to be performed on a daily or weekly basis.  A sample action-oriented goal statement is, “I will complete 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week.” Another example is, “I will walk briskly for two miles on three days each week.”   Action-oriented goals may also be referred to as process- or performance-oriented goals since they are often steps in a process or behaviors that are performed by an individual.  Outcome-Oriented Goals\n Represents the desired end result, or outcome, to be attained. Outcome-oriented goals often require more time to achieve, therefore, these types of goals are often long-term.  A sample outcome-oriented goal is, “I will lose 10 pounds over the next two months.” Another example, is “I will decrease my 5K race time to less than 24 minutes by the end of the summer.” In both examples, the goal represents a desired outcome that will result from adherence to a specific exercise program spanning several months.    It is common for clients to express their goals in terms of an outcome they desire.\n However, it is the personal trainer’s role to help identify a safe and effective plan or exercise program through which this outcome will be achieved. As such, the personal trainer will help the client to focus on the achievement of established action-oriented goals that lead to the desired outcome. When outcome-oriented goals are overemphasized, a client may become frustrated or discouraged if measurable progress is not achieved within what the client may perceive to be a realistic timeframe. By re-focusing the client’s attention on the accomplishment of action-oriented goals, motivation is sustained and self-efficacy increases. In addition, since the client controls their own behavior, achieving short-term action-oriented goals fosters a sense of empowerment.  SMART Goals An effective goal-setting strategy is to establish SMART goals.\nSMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.\n Specific:  Establish clear, well-defined goals. The goal must specifically indicate exactly what is to be accomplished. The goal must be easily understood and unambiguous.   Measurable:  The goal statement should include an objective method of measuring the progress toward and attainment of the goal. A quantifiable measurement allows for easy tracking of progress toward the goal and a clear indication of goal achievement.   Attainable:  A goal should be realistically attainable. If the individual believes in their ability to accomplish the goal, then the individual will feel greater motivation and persevere over obstacles to attain the goal. It is important for goal statements to be reasonably challenging; however, establishing goals that are obviously too lofty may cause frustration, discouragement, and demotivation.   Relevant:  The goal should be relevant to the unique needs, interests, and abilities of the individual. Action-oriented goals must correlate to the desired long-term outcome. When a goal is relevant, the individual goal-seeker will buy into the goal, and be motivated to strive toward achievement. As such, goal-setting must be a collaborative process including the client to ensure relevance to their interests and desires.   Time-Bound:  Effective goal-statements identify the specific timeframe within which the goal is to be achieved. Short-term action-oriented goals are often framed around an action or behavior to be performed on a daily or weekly basis. Long-term outcome-oriented goals often designate a future date or deadline by which the goal will be achieved.    It should be noted that many variations of the SMART acronym do exist, with some similarities and some differences. Regardless of the goal-setting approach, it is obvious that successful behavior change is facilitated by well-defined goals.\nMotivational Interviewing Motivational interviewing has been shown to be an effective approach to facilitate the adoption and maintenance of healthy lifestyle behaviors including physical activity. Motivational interviewing, or MI for short, was originally introduced in the early 1980s by psychologist, Dr. William Miller and further developed and described with his colleague Dr. Stephen Rollnick.\nIn the most recent edition of their popular book, Motivational Interviewing: Helping People Change, Miller and Rollnick (2013) offer several definitions of motivational interviewing. The layperson’s definition of motivational interviewing states:\n “Motivational interviewing is a collaborative conversation style for strengthening a person’s own motivation and commitment to change.”\n Miller and Rollnick (2013) also provide a more technical definition which states:\n “Motivational interviewing is a collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change. It is designed to strengthen personal motivation for, and commitment to, a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the person’s own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion.”\n Motivational interviewing has become central to the strategies used by health \u0026 wellness coaches to guide their clients through the process of behavioral change. MI is also gaining popularity among exercise professionals as a method to help clients adopt and maintain healthy lifestyle behaviors. In the book, Motivational Interviewing in Nutrition and Fitness, authors Clifford and Curtis (2016) note, “Clients typically know what they should do with regard to eating and physical activity, but there are many reasons why they don’t.\"\nMotivational interviewing is a client-centered, yet goal-oriented method for helping people to resolve ambivalence about health behavior change by evoking intrinsic motivation and strengthening commitment to change.\nThe Spirit of MI (PACE) The underlying spirit of motivational interviewing affects every aspect of how you interact with a client, including both verbal and nonverbal communication.\nSpirit of MI includes: Partnership, Acceptance, Compassion, and Evocation.\n  Partnership\n The first of four aspects of the spirit of MI is that it involves partnership. MI is done ‘for' and ‘with' a person. It is an active collaboration between experts. The client is the undisputed expert on themselves. When using MI, the exercise professional is a companion who typically does less than half of the talking. MI is like dancing rather than wrestling. One person moves with rather than against the other person. The exercise professional must willingly suspend the reflexive urge to provide expert advise.    Acceptance\n Related to this spirit of partnership is an attitude of profound acceptance of the client. Acceptance has been described as including four aspects:  First, acceptance involves recognizing and appreciating the inherent absolute worth and potential of every human being. A second key aspect of acceptance is accurate empathy, an active interest in and effort to understand the other’s internal perspective, to see the world through his or her eyes. Third, acceptance involves autonomy support. In other words, honoring and respecting each person’s autonomy, their irrevocable right and capacity of self-direction and independence. Finally, acceptance involves affirmation, to seek and acknowledge the person’s strengths and efforts.      Compassion\n Next, to be compassionate is to actively promote the client’s welfare and to give priority to their needs. Compassion is a deliberate commitment to pursue and support the best interests of the client. To work with a spirit of compassion is to have your heart in the right place so that the trust you engender will be deserved.    Evocation\n Whereas many assessments and evaluations are often focused on detecting deficits to be addressed by the exercise professional, the spirit of MI starts from a very different strengths-focused premise, that people already have within them much of the knowledge and skill that is needed for change. In this regard, the role of the exercise professional is to evoke this intrinsic knowledge regarding how to change. The personal trainer brings their expertise about exercise science, program design, and how to perform specific exercises, but the client must uncover their own why and want to perform the exercise program.    Core Principles of MI In addition to the underlying spirit, there are several core principles that guide motivational interviewing.\nExpress Empathy\n The personal trainer demonstrates respect for and acceptance of the client and their feelings, encourages a nonjudgmental and collaborative relationship, uses active listening techniques, and recognizes that ambivalence to behavior change is normal.  Develop Discrepancy\n Change is motivated by a perceived discrepancy between one’s present behavior and important personal goals and values. The client rather than the personal trainer, should present the arguments in favor of change, known as ‘change talk'. The personal trainer helps to recognize discrepancies and draws the client’s attention to them. One way to enhance a client’s motivation for change is to help him or her recognize a discrepancy or gap between future goals and current behavior. When people see that their actions conflict with important personal values such as health, success, or family happiness, change is more likely to occur.  Roll with Resistance\n Avoid arguing for change, new perspectives are invited not imposed, the client is the primary source of answers and solutions to adopt a new behavior. Resistance is a signal to respond with a different approach. Also, recognize ambivalence: the client may not resist change, but may simply display indifference to change. The personal trainer needs to explore with questions to identify what area of the client’s health behaviors they agree need to change and that the need for change is important enough to discuss.  Support Self-Efficacy\n The client’s belief in the possibility of change is a strong motivator, the personal trainer’s belief in the client becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Communicate belief in the client’s capacity to achieve their goals. Remember, positive social persuasion can strengthen self-efficacy toward exercise or healthy eating.  Avoid Argumentation\n Power struggles between a personal trainer and a client do not enhance motivation for change. The goal is to accompany clients through behavioral change, not force or drag them along. In the long-term, trying to convince a client to exercise or eat healthy foods is largely ineffective. Pushing a client to make a change often backfires, causing the client to dig in their heels and avoid change.  Key Processes of MI Motivational interviewing involves four key processes: engaging, focusing, evoking, and planning.\nEngaging\n The first of these processes. Establish rapport, mutual trust, and a respectful helping relationship. Questions to ask yourself may include:  How comfortable is this person talking to me? How comfortable do I feel in this conversation? How supportive and helpful am I being? Does this feel like a collaborative partnership? Do I understand this person’s perspective and concerns?    Focusing\n Identify and maintain a specific direction in the motivational interviewing conversation about change. Questions to ask yourself may include:  What goals for change does this person really have? Do I have a clear sense of where we are going? Does it feel like we are moving together, not in different directions? Does this feel more like dancing or wrestling? Are we working together with a common purpose?    Evoking\n The process of discovering the client’s own motivation for change, assisting clients to overcome their ambivalence to change, guiding clients to recognize discrepancies between their current behavior and their broader life goals or values, and to elicit client statements in favor change, again such statements are known as “change talk”. Questions to think to yourself may include:  What are the person’s own reasons for change? Is the reluctance more about confidence or importance for change? What ‘change talk' am I hearing? Is my personal knowledge pulling me to be the one arguing for change?    Planning\n which encompasses developing commitment to change and formulating a specific action plan. Questions for yourself may include:  What would be a reasonable next step toward change? Am I remembering to evoke rather than prescribe a plan? What would help this person to move forward?    Core Interviewing Skills of MI (OARS) The final aspect of MI brings us full circle back to effective communication discussed in section two.\nThere are four core communication skills that are important in engaging and throughout the process of motivational interviewing.\nTaken together, these skills form the acronym O.A.R.S.\n  Open Questions\n Questions that do not limit an individual’s response and invite elaboration; often uncovering more subjective and emotionally-based thoughts such as personal opinions, feelings, and beliefs.    Affirming\n Statements that accentuate the positive; to affirm is to recognize and acknowledge that which is good including the individual’s inherent strengths and worth.    Reflecting\n Re-stating the client’s statements to confirm understanding, validate assumptions, thoughts or feelings, and to enable the client to ‘see' themselves in a new way. Refer back to various types of reflection statements covered in section two.    Summarizing\n A reflective statement that pulls together several ideas or thoughts communicated by the client.    Using a motivational interviewing approach and active listening skills, the personal trainer is much more likely to help their clients to adopt and maintain lifelong healthy living habits.\nTo learn more about motivational interviewing and to enhance your communication and coaching skills as a personal trainer, you are encouraged to read Miller and Rollnick’s book, Motivational Interviewing: Helping People Change, and Clifford and Curtis’s book, Motivational Interviewing in Nutrition and Fitness.\n",

<p>Section one of the first module provides a broad overview of the role of a personal trainer.</p>
<p>This section will outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>the major tasks of a personal trainer</li>
<li>the requisite knowledge associated with these tasks</li>
<li>NETA&rsquo;s Professional Code of Ethics</li>
<li>continuing education requirements for NETA-Certified Personal Trainers</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="tasks-and-knowledge-statements">Tasks and Knowledge Statements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tasks-and-knowledge-statements">#</a></h2>
<p>As defined in the NETA Certification Board&rsquo;s Exam Candidate Handbook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Personal trainers are fitness professionals who promote health. They accomplish this by developing and implementing exercise programs designed to safely and effectively meet the unique goals of the clients they serve. This practice takes place in the context of their unwavering commitment to client safety and service and their adherence to the highest principles of ethical behavior.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professionally-certified Personal Trainers perform a wide variety of tasks, each of which requires the acquisition of underlying knowledge and skill in order to safely and effectively perform each task.</p>
<h3 id="major-tasks">Major Tasks<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#major-tasks">#</a></h3>
<p>What are the major tasks performed by a personal trainer?</p>
<p><em>NETA&rsquo;s Personal Trainer practice analysis outlines 24 task statements related to the role of a personal trainer.</em></p>
<p><strong>Some examples of tasks commonly performed by personal trainers include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Establish rapport and build professional relationships with clients</li>
<li>Perform initial consultations with prospective clients to discuss desired health and fitness outcomes</li>
<li>Conduct health screening and fitness assessments to gather objective data about the client&rsquo;s current health, risk factors, and current level of physical fitness</li>

<h3 id="required-knowledge-andor-skills">Required Knowledge and/or Skills<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#required-knowledge-andor-skills">#</a></h3>
<p><em>A series of Knowledge statements are listed for each of the 24 task statements included on NETA&rsquo;s Personal Training practice analysis. In total, there are 36 unique knowledge statements included throughout the Personal Training practice analysis.</em></p>
<p>What knowledge and/or skills does a personal trainer need to perform these tasks?</p>
<p><strong>To perform these tasks a personal trainer must have knowledge of:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Active listening techniques and coaching methods</li>
<li>Theoretical models of behavioral change</li>
<li>Types of goals and goal-setting strategies</li>
<li>Preparticipation screening recommendations and risk factors for disease</li>
<li>Health screening and fitness assessment protocols</li>
<li>Exercise-related anatomy, kinesiology, biomechanics and physiology</li>

<li>NETA&rsquo;s Professional Code of Ethics</li>
</ul>
<p><em>These represent some, but not all, of the 36 knowledge statements on NETA&rsquo;s Personal Trainer practice analysis.</em></p>
<h2 id="professional-code-of-ethics">Professional Code of Ethics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#professional-code-of-ethics">#</a></h2>
<p>The overarching purpose of a professional certification is to protect the public, both to ensure that Certified Personal Trainers are minimally competent to deliver safe and effective fitness services, but also to provide some reassurance that NETA-Certified Personal Trainers will conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner.</p>
<p>NETA-Certified Professionals must be familiar with and abide by NETA&rsquo;s Professional Code of Ethics. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action and possible revocation of certifications issued by NETA.</p>
<p><strong>In accordance with NETA&rsquo;s Professional Code of Ethics, NETA-Certified Professionals must:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Respect the rights, welfare, privacy, and dignity of clients, co-workers, and the public at large.</li>
<li>Provide and maintain a safe and effective training environment and exercise programming.</li>
<li>Provide equal, fair, and reasonable treatment for all individuals.</li>
<li>Comply with all applicable laws governing business practices, employment, and property usage.
Comply with all applicable laws governing business practices, employment, and property usage.</li>
<li>Respect and maintain the confidentiality of all client information.</li>
<li>Maintain appropriate documentation (e.g., informed consent, PAR-Q, health &amp; lifestyle questionnaire, progress notes, training logs, etc.).</li>
<li>Recognize and abide by the recognized scope of practice consistent with exercise certification(s) held; avoid actions or behaviors restricted to the scope practice for adjacent health care professionals.</li>
<li>Do not diagnose illness, injury, or medical conditions; refer clients to a more qualified health, fitness, or medical professional when appropriate.</li>
<li>Strive to remain up-to-date with current practical and theoretical fitness/health research through continuing education, conferences, home studies, and networking with other fitness professionals.</li>
<li>Maintain a current appropriate first-responder emergency certification. Personal trainers must maintain a valid adult CPR/AED Certification. CPR/AED certification must include a hands-on practical skills evaluation.</li>
<li>Establish and practice clear professional boundaries.</li>
<li>Avoid engaging with any behavior or conduct that could be construed as a conflict of interest or reflects adversely on the fitness profession, NETA, or on the NETA-CB.</li>
<li>Represent credentials and certifications in an honest, accurate, and appropriate manner.</li>
<li>Strive to protect the public from those who misrepresent the health and fitness professions or are in direct violation of this code of ethics by communicating concerns with the NETA-CB.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="continuing-education">Continuing Education<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#continuing-education">#</a></h2>
<p>Passing a certification exam demonstrates to the public, employers, and other stakeholders that the certificant possess at least minimum competence and knowledge to deliver fitness services as a personal trainer. However, gaining expertise and becoming truly skilled as a personal trainer requires many years of high quality experience and continuing education. Earning NETA&rsquo;s Personal Trainer certification is just the beginning of this educational journey. Similar to credentials earned in other adjacent health fields and professions, all NCCA-accredited fitness certifications require continuing education to maintain the credential.</p>
<p><strong>NETA&rsquo;s Personal Trainer Certification is valid for two years from the date of issue.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To renew a NETA Personal Trainer Certification, the certificant must earn a minimum of twenty (20) continuing education credits (CECs) during the two-year period between the certification&rsquo;s date of issue and the designated expiration date.</li>
<li>Continuing education credits may be earned by attending live events such as workshops or conferences, or by completing home study courses.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For more information regarding recertification requirements, please refer to NETA&rsquo;s website and/or the NETA Certification Board&rsquo;s Recertification Handbook.</em></p>
<p>Scientific research, industry standards, programming guidelines, and best-practices are constantly evolving in the fitness industry. It is important that NETA-Certified Personal Trainers take responsibility to stay well-informed of these changes and advancements.</p>
<h2 id="identifying-credible-sources-of-information">Identifying Credible Sources of Information<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#identifying-credible-sources-of-information">#</a></h2>
<p>It can be very challenging for both consumers and exercise professionals to navigate the endless volumes of health and fitness information that is readily available at the click of a mouse. Social media, self-proclaimed expert bloggers, internet websites, and consumer-oriented magazines offer advice and ‘ground-breaking' scientific evidence regarding the best approaches to loss weight, increase fitness, and improve health. The information is often conflicting and confusing.</p>
<p>How can an exercise professional determine if information is credible and reliable?</p>
<p>Here are some questions to ask yourself when evaluating sources of health and fitness information:</p>
<p><strong>What is the source of this information?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What type company or organization (e.g., nonprofit organization, government agency, for-profit business, educational institution) is disseminating this information?</li>
<li>Frequently, website addresses ending in “.edu,” “.gov,” or “.org” are known and reputable organizations or institutions.</li>
<li>Be cautious of sites that have an address ending in “.com” as they are commercial sites and may be selling a product or service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Has the content or information been verified or undergone an expert panel or peer review process?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reputable scientific journals and industry publications utilize a panel or an editorial board comprised of recognized experts who review and evaluate articles prior to acceptance for publication.</li>
<li>The peer review process provides some reassurance of academic quality and validity of information or research.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the author&rsquo;s credentials or qualifications?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Are the author&rsquo;s credentials clearly provided?</li>
<li>Are the author&rsquo;s education, background, and expertise consistent with the subject matter being presented?</li>
<li>Does the author provide contact information?</li>
<li>Does the author have any obvious conflicts of interest?</li>
<li>Be leery of self-proclaimed experts who lack the requisite academic background, credentials, and professional experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does the author provide appropriate references?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is the underlying source of information considered credible?</li>
<li>Have other reputable authors or organizations referenced this information?</li>
<li>Is the author accurately presenting the referenced information?</li>
<li>Take some extra time to check into the references.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this information consistent with known facts or information obtained from other reputable sources?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is the author providing the information in a biased manner or presenting facts out of context?</li>
<li>Does the information seem plausible?</li>
<li>New scientific research may challenge long-held beliefs and even change a paradigm, but be skeptical if one source of information conflicts with the general consensus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When was the information published or last updated?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is the information current or perhaps outdated?</li>
<li>Do the references site current research or is it years or perhaps decades old?</li>
<li>The information may be outdated.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="section-2-communication--relationship-building">Section 2: Communication &amp; Relationship Building<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-2-communication--relationship-building">#</a></h1>
<p>Section two of this module reviews communication skills and relationship building.</p>
<p>Topics covered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>making a positive first impression</li>
<li>establishing rapport</li>
<li>interpreting body language</li>
<li>questioning, reflecting, and other active listening skills</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="making-a-positive-first-impression">Making a Positive First Impression<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#making-a-positive-first-impression">#</a></h2>
<p>The initial reaction and first impressions formed during an encounter with another person have a lasting effect on the development of a relationship, or lack thereof, between two people. These first impressions are made quickly, often during the initial moments of a conversation or even through observations made prior to any verbal communication.</p>
<p><strong>7-11 Rule of First Impressions</strong> suggests that people make eleven decisions about you within the first seven seconds of an initial interaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>These eleven decisions include:
<ul>
<li>are you friendly</li>
<li>attractive</li>
<li>knowledgeable</li>
<li>professional</li>
<li>empathetic</li>
<li>credible</li>
<li>confident</li>
<li>clean</li>
<li>helpful</li>
<li>courteous</li>
<li>responsive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers have also suggested that within 10 milliseconds of seeing a stranger&rsquo;s face, people make five trait judgments regarding an individual&rsquo;s:</p>
<ul>
<li>attractiveness</li>
<li>likeability</li>
<li>trustworthiness</li>
<li>competence</li>
<li>aggressiveness</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In addition, researchers have theorized that we analyze our first impressions of another person in an effort to predict the likelihood that future contact with this person will bring us personal rewards and positive outcomes.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on these first impressions, we proceed to develop relationships with those we expect to be most rewarding and we limit or restrict interaction with those who appear to have fewer benefits to offer.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Whether you realize it or not, you are being watched. Potential clients, class participants, and club members make countless decisions and judgments about you, often even before an actual interaction.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>People are casually assessing your attitude, demeanor, professionalism, and competence, among many other attributes. Their assessment will often determine whether or not they will initiate or reciprocate a conversation with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how can you make a positive first impression?</p>
<p><strong>The following strategies may help to create a positive first impression:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dress for success and look like a true professional</strong>
<ul>
<li>Wear appropriately-fitted and clean clothes (e.g., club-logo&rsquo;ed apparel, shirt tucked in, looking sharp)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Attend to your personal hygiene</strong>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are well-groomed, with fresh breath, and minimize the use of heavy fragrances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Be attentive to your clients needs and other members in the club</strong>
<ul>
<li>When working with a client or club member, stay engaged</li>
<li>Keep your focus on the individual with whom you are working</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Monitor your body language</strong>
<ul>
<li>Be aware of the messages you send, both positive and negative, through your posture, body position, facial expressions, and use of physical cues</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Smile</strong>
<ul>
<li>An authentic smile often receives a smile in return</li>
<li>Smiling is a simple way to make a positive first impression</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Start with a professional greeting</strong>
<ul>
<li>When meeting someone remember to smile, make eye contact, shake hands with confidence and respect, introduce yourself first, and engage the other person in casual conversation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Listen carefully to others</strong>
<ul>
<li>Listening is among the best conversational strategies to make a positive first impression and to establish rapport with others</li>
<li>The less you talk, the greater your opportunity to get to know the real person standing (or sitting) in front of you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Speak clearly</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use non-technical language when possible</li>
<li>Communicate with confidence, clearly articulate words, and ask thoughtful questions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>And last, follow the ‘golden rule', treat others as you would like to be treated</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="building-relationships-rapport">Building Relationships: Rapport<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#building-relationships-rapport">#</a></h2>
<p>The first step toward building a meaningful relationship with another person is to establish rapport.</p>
<p><strong>Rapport</strong> may be simply defined as a positive interaction or connection experienced between two people.</p>
<p><em>It has been proposed that rapport is created through the interrelation of three components including mutual attentiveness, positivity, and coordination:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mutual attentiveness</strong> is displayed through a shared expression of interest with one another</li>
<li><strong>Positivity</strong> is seen as the reciprocation of friendliness and caring during an interaction</li>
<li><strong>Coordination</strong> can also be thought of as harmony or balance between two individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>Although some people may be particularly skilled at developing rapport, it is not an inherent personality trait, but rather an experience that results from the combination of qualities that emerge from each individual during an interaction. This positive connection or experience may be expressed when people say they &ldquo;hit it off&rdquo;, &ldquo;clicked&rdquo;, &ldquo;had good chemistry&rdquo;, &ldquo;were on the same page&rdquo;, or &ldquo;in sync&rdquo;.</p>
<p><em><strong>Establishing rapport is the critical first step of communication.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Rapport leads to trust
<ul>
<li>trust leads to open communication
<ul>
<li>open communication leads to better understanding of the other person</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of rapport between two individuals is believed to facilitate influence and responsiveness, which is essential for fitness professionals when building relationships with club members and prospects and facilitating behavioral change for their clients.</p>
<p>Certainly, if rapport is established with another person, then that individual is more inclined to like, trust, and respect you, which increases the probability that they may want to utilize your fitness services.</p>
<p><em>In short, rapport is about getting people to like you….</em></p>
<h3 id="making-people-like-you">Making People Like You<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#making-people-like-you">#</a></h3>
<p>In his best selling book, <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em>, Dale Carnegie introduces six ways to make people like you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>First, become genuinely interested in other people</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>As Carnegie notes, “You can make more friends in 2 weeks by taking interest in other people than you can make in 2 months trying to get others to take interest in you”</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Smile</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>One of the best ways to make a positive first impression</li>
<li>A genuine smile is often reflected with another smile</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Remember people&rsquo;s names</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Carry a pocket notebook when you are working in the fitness center</li>
<li>After you meet someone, write down their name, a brief description, and any noteworthy characteristics or topics of conversation</li>
<li>Refer to your name book to remember those you meet</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Be a good listener</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The most important communication skill is listening</li>
<li>The more you listen, the more you learn about the other person…and the more they enjoy talking with you since you are taking interest in their favorite topic: them</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Talk in terms of the other person&rsquo;s interests</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Keep the ‘spotlight' on the other person</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not about you, it&rsquo;s all about them</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>One of the deepest human needs is the desire to feel important</li>
<li>Satisfy this need and others will be naturally attracted to your company</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="approaching-members">Approaching Members<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#approaching-members">#</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing personal trainers is acquiring and retaining clients.</p>
<ul>
<li>For some, connecting with people, developing relationships, and obtaining clients may seem effortless. However, the success of many personal trainers is limited by fear of rejection, self-doubt, or poor communication skills all of which stifle attempts to build their clientele.</li>
<li>To establish yourself as a successful trainer, it is important to proactively approach members in the fitness center, making connections with potential clients.</li>
<li>Creating visibility and connecting with members (i.e., prospects for your personal training services) is an important strategy to build your clientele.</li>
<li>However, the manner in which exercise professionals approach members will have a significant influence on the trajectory of their relationships.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-wrong-way">The Wrong Way<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-wrong-way">#</a></h3>
<p>Avoid approaching members with questions that may be perceived as judgmental, condescending, or may question their competency.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>“Can I make a suggestion?”</li>
<li>“…recommend a better way of doing that?”</li>
<li>“…show you a different technique?”</li>
<li>“…help you with that exercise?”</li>
<li>“…show you the right way to do that?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although you have good intentions to help, you may be unknowingly insulting the member or causing them to feel embarrassed. This is generally not an effective approach to establish rapport.</p>
<p>Although some may accept your advice, many others may react negatively. In fact, many people have a conditioned response to decline an offer of assistance, similar to the way one may respond to a salesperson who asks, “Can I help you find something?” Without giving it much thought many will automatically reply, “No thanks, I&rsquo;m just looking.” Although a member or prospect may turn you down using different words, when they respond to your close-ended question with a “No,” it is very difficult for you to move forward creating a positive connection with that person. An opportunity lost!</p>
<h3 id="the-right-way">The Right Way<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-right-way">#</a></h3>
<p>The first interaction with a member or prospect must be professional, pleasant, and most important, non-threatening.</p>
<p><strong>“Greet-and-Go”</strong> is a brief interaction that allows you to make contact with the member, to introduce yourself, and let them know you are available without placing any pressure on them or giving them the opportunity to respond, “No”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce yourself by name</li>
<li>Compliment something specific</li>
<li>Let them know you are available to enrich their experience in your facility</li>
<li>Ask for their name</li>
<li>Leave them alone</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-goal">The Goal<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-goal">#</a></h3>
<p>The goal of your first interaction with a member is not to correct a mistake, offer unsolicited advice, or attempt to educate.</p>
<p><em>Your goal is simply to establish a positive connection with the member, to learn their name, and to let them know who you are.</em></p>
<p>You are just breaking the ice for future interactions. You will have other opportunities to gather more information and eventually to provide instruction as necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>First you want them to like you and to trust you.</li>
<li>Immediately after this initial interaction, write the member&rsquo;s name down in your name book (i.e., a pocket notebook).</li>
<li>Also include a brief description of the member and any other noteworthy characteristics or topics from the conversation.</li>
<li>Use this for future reference to help you remember members' names.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: If the member is doing something that is an IMMEDIATE danger for either themselves or the people around them, then you MUST intervene. The objective in this case is safety.</em></p>
<p>If the member is performing a questionable exercise or doing something in a less than ideal manner (i.e., not likely to present an immediate danger), then connect with them first, correct them later.</p>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-a-message-body-language">The Impact of a Message: Body Language<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-impact-of-a-message-body-language">#</a></h2>
<p>The word <em>communication</em> originates from the Latin word <em>&ldquo;communis&rdquo;</em>, meaning to share or to make common.</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong> is the act of conveying and receiving information through the exchange of messages delivered by speech, visual aids, signals, writing, body language, or behavior.</p>
<p><em>The information you deliver to and receive from another individual is represented by both verbal and nonverbal messages:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verbal messages</strong> include both <strong>the words you speak</strong> and <strong>how you express these words</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is has been estimated that only <strong>7%</strong> of the message you send or receive is communicated by <strong>what you say</strong> <em>(verbal message)</em></li>
<li>An additional <strong>38%</strong> of the message is conveyed by <strong>how you say the words</strong> <em>(paraverbal message)</em>
<ul>
<li>This includes elements such as your tone of voice, pronunciation, speaking rate, and vocal projection</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nonverbal communication</strong> which includes body language, facial expressions, gestures, posture, and movements of the head is the final <strong>55%</strong> of the message</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these percentages are commonly referenced, it is likely that the relative importance of words, tonality, and body language is dependent on the context of the communication (e.g., phone conversations).</p>

<h3 id="interpreting-body-language">Interpreting Body Language<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#interpreting-body-language">#</a></h3>
<p>Observing and correctly interpreting the body language of another person is a nonverbal communication skill.</p>
<p><strong>Body language</strong> may include any number of conscious or unconscious movements of the body used to communicate a message to another person.</p>
<ul>
<li>These methods of communication may include facial expressions, eye contact, head and body position, posture, and gestures.</li>
<li>These often hidden messages delivered through nonverbal cues both compliment and at times contradict the spoken word.</li>
<li>In addition to delivering a message, these cues may also reflect attitudes and feelings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the messages delivered through body language play such a crucial role in communication, it&rsquo;s important for the fitness professional to recognize, interpret, and understand these nonverbal signals.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean?&hellip;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arms crossed:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Holding the arms folded across the chest is a defensive closed position, suggesting an unwillingness to communicate or disagreement with the statement or opinion of the person</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hand over mouth:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Holding the hand in front of the mouth may suggest the individual is not being truthful and is trying to hide their words or cover the lie</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rubbing side of nose:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Touching or lightly rubbing the side of the nose may suggest disbelief, doubt, deception, or that the person is being untruthful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Finger tapping:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tapping the fingers may indicate that the person is growing impatient or may signal boredom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Touching the chin:</strong>

<h2 id="active-listening-skills">Active Listening Skills<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#active-listening-skills">#</a></h2>
<p>Active listening is a communication skill based on the work of psychologist Carl Rogers.</p>
<p><strong>Active listening</strong> helps to build rapport, trust, and understanding. Verbal active listening skills convey to the speaker that you are paying attention and comprehending their message.</p>
<p><em>Some common verbal active listening skills include questioning, repeating, paraphrasing, reflecting, clarifying, summarizing, and the use of minimal encouragers:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Questioning</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allows us to gather information using both open- and closed-ended questions</li>
<li>By asking thoughtful and relevant questions the listener also helps to reinforce that they have an interest in what the speaker has to say</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Repeating</strong>
<ul>
<li>Simply restating or parroting a message using exactly the same words as used by the speaker</li>
<li>Repeating or parroting should be used sparingly in normal conversation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Paraphrasing</strong>
<ul>
<li>A restatement of a message that retains the original meaning, but using similar yet different words to achieve greater clarity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reflecting</strong>
<ul>
<li>Closely repeating or paraphrasing what the speaker has said in order to demonstrate or gain understanding</li>
<li>In addition to reflecting the content of the spoken message, reflective statements also allow the listener to convey a guess regarding the meaning of a statement or underlying feelings and emotions of the speaker</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Clarifying</strong>
<ul>
<li>Often involves asking follow-up questions to confirm understanding of the message, or to gather additional information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A summary statement</strong>
<ul>
<li>Brings together the facts or multiple pieces of information to check understanding</li>
<li>Summarizing involves taking the main points of a message or conversation and reiterating them in a logical and clear manner, giving the speaker an opportunity to correct if necessary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Minimal encouragers</strong>
<ul>
<li>Brief, positive prompts such as words, phrases, or even non-verbal head nods to keep the conversation going and to show you are listening</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asking-questions">Asking Questions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#asking-questions">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Questioning</strong> is an active listening skill used to collect information. There are two general categories of questions: closed-ended and open-ended.</p>
<p>Thoughtful and relevant questions also help to reinforce that the listener is engaged and interested in what the speak has to say.</p>
<p><strong>Closed-Ended Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Call for a short answer and limit the individual&rsquo;s response options</li>
<li>Many closed-ended questions are answered with either a yes or no
<ul>
<li>For example, “Do you smoke?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Closed-ended questions may also collect a specific piece of information
<ul>
<li>For example, “How many days per week do you exercise?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some closed-ended questions may feel like multiple choice questions
<ul>
<li>For example, “Which of the following pieces of cardiorespiratory equipment do you enjoy the most, treadmill, elliptical trainer, or bike?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generally speaking, closed-ended questions tend to seek factual information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Open-Ended Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Invite the individual to provide a more elaborate response</li>
<li>Open-ended questions offer the respondent a great deal of freedom in their reply</li>
<li>Open-ended questions often begin with “what” or “how,” and are used to explore someone&rsquo;s thoughts, feelings, and opinions
<ul>
<li>For example, “What do you enjoy about exercise?” or “How will your life be different when you reach your target weight?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other times, an open-ended question may take the form of an indirect question presented as a statement
<ul>
<li>For example, “Tell me about your current exercise program.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open-ended questions may also begin with “Why”; however, “why” questions should be used with caution since questions of this nature may feel judgmental, evoke defensiveness, or result in an unproductive “I don&rsquo;t know” reply</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Asking open-ended questions is a fundamental skill used in motivational interviewing, which will be presented in the next section of this module.</em></p>
<h3 id="reflective-statements">Reflective Statements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#reflective-statements">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Reflective statements</strong> help the listener to confirm understanding of the speaker&rsquo;s message and allow the listener to convey a guess regarding the meaning of a statement or underlying feelings and emotions of the speaker.</p>
<p><em>Reflections allow the speaker to hear their own words, to see things from a different perspective, and to better understand the meaning behind their own statements.</em></p>
<p>Reflective statements are an important active listening skill and are utilized extensively with motivational interviewing as presented in the next section.</p>
<p>There are many different types of reflective statements:</p>
<p><strong>Simple Reflection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paraphrases and restates the speaker&rsquo;s message, utilizing their own words without exaggeration, interpretation, or distortion</li>
<li>For example, if a client states, “I have been so busy with work and family that I just don&rsquo;t have time to exercise,” then the personal trainer may reply with a simple reflection such as, <em>“I hear you saying that you don&rsquo;t have time to exercise due to your busy schedule of work and family obligations.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Complex Reflection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adds some meaning or emphasis to what the speaker has stated, making a guess about the unspoken message or what might be coming next</li>
<li>A complex reflection in response to the same client statement seen above may be, <em>“So you would like to take time to exercise, but you are just too busy and overwhelmed with work and family obligations.”</em></li>
<li>Although the client has not stated a desire to exercise, the trainer&rsquo;s reflection adds the suggestion that the client would like to exercise, if their schedule would permit</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amplified Reflection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moves a statement to one extreme, maximizing or minimizing what the speaker has said with hope of evoking disagreement from the speaker in the direction of change talk, which is a statement in favor of a desired behavior</li>
<li>Again, in response to the same client statement, the trainer may reply with an amplified reflection like, <em>“So, I hear you saying that it&rsquo;s absolutely impossible for you to make time for exercise in your schedule.”</em></li>
<li>A reflection of this nature may prompt the client to realize it is not absolutely impossible, but rather there are some options that would allow time for exercise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Double-Sided Reflection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledges the speaker&rsquo;s ambivalence toward change by restating points both in favor or against making a change</li>
<li>For example, the trainer states, <em>“It sounds like you are just too busy to fit exercise into your schedule. However, I remember you have also mentioned that exercise makes you feel better and helps to manage the stresses of  your demanding schedule.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reflection of Feeling</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Involves expressing in one&rsquo;s own words the emotions implied by the speaker</li>
<li>A feeling reflection may also present a guess on how the speaker may be feeling</li>
<li>Feelings can be reflected from both verbal and nonverbal messages from the speaker</li>
<li>Using the same client statement, the personal trainer may speculate on the client&rsquo;s feeling by stating, <em>“So you are feeling overwhelmed by all of your commitments and frustrated that exercise has not fit into your schedule.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reframing Reflection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Suggest a different meaning or perspective for what the speaker has described</li>
<li>For example, if a client states, “Lately, my husband has really been bothering me to begin an exercise program,” the personal trainer may reframe the statement by saying, <em>“Your husband must really care about you and would like to see you remain healthy.”</em></li>
<li>This takes the negative tone of the client&rsquo;s statement and reframes it in a more positive manner</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflections are an essential skill used in motivational interviewing. An overview of motivational interviewing will be presented in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="barriers-to-listening">Barriers to Listening<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#barriers-to-listening">#</a></h3>
<p>As stated by psychologist Carl Rogers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Attentive listening means giving one&rsquo;s total and undivided attention to the other person and tells the other that we are interested and concerned.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listening is a skill that requires focus and practice. Unfortunately, there are many barriers that can derail attentive listening.</p>
<p><em><strong>A common communication error made by many health and exercise professionals is simply talking too much.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are dominating the conversation, talking too much, and providing information, then you are not listening or learning about the other individual.</li>
<li>As a general rule, you should allow the other person to do most of the talking.</li>
<li><em>It has been suggested that the other person should be speaking 70% of the time; where you as the listener speak 30% of the time, asking open-ended questions and using reflective statements.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Other potential listening barriers are <strong>internal distractions</strong> such as your own thoughts, feelings, and biases.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, rather than truly listening to the speaker, you may be thinking about what you are going to say next or thinking about something completely off topic, like where you have to be after the meeting or what you are going to make for dinner.</li>
<li>Feelings and emotions can also create an internal distraction from attentive listening.</li>
<li>Feeling angry, upset, or anxious can all interfere with your ability to listen.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Listening barriers may also be external distractions such as noise in the fitness center, a cell phone vibrating in your pocket indicating a call, email, or text message, or visual distractions such as another member doing an unsafe exercise, or a TV diverting your attention.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Your knowledge and expertise as an exercise professional may also create a potential listening barrier.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Like other health care providers, exercise professionals may feel an obligation and a strong temptation to help others by solving their problem and disseminating expert advice.</li>
<li>However, in doing so the personal trainer is likely to spend too much time talking and educating the client at the expense of listening, learning, and understanding the client&rsquo;s situation and true needs.</li>
<li>In addition, by prematurely offering solutions to the client&rsquo;s presumed problem, it takes responsibility away from the client and disempowers them, which may decrease the likelihood the client will follow this expert advice and achieve behavioral change.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it may cause the client to feel belittled or patronized, which may hinder rapport.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Remember, “No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care.”</em></p>

<h1 id="section-3-motivation--behavior-change">Section 3: Motivation &amp; Behavior Change<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-3-motivation--behavior-change">#</a></h1>
<p>As personal trainers, we often devote much of our time and attention to exercise sciences, physiology, and the technical aspects of developing and implementing an exercise program. However, even the most scientifically sound and well-designed exercise program will be ineffective if the client will not adhere to the plan. Knowledge of psychology of exercise and behavior change is also essential to the success of a personal trainer, and of course their clients.</p>
<p>Section three of this module reviews motivation and behavior change:</p>
<ul>
<li>types of motivation and motivators</li>
<li>the concept of self-efficacy</li>
<li>the transtheoretical model of behavior change</li>
<li>goal-setting strategies</li>
<li>motivational interviewing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#motivation">#</a></h2>
<p>Changing a behavior or adopting a new behavior, such as starting an exercise program or eating a healthier diet requires motivation. <em>So, what is motivation?</em></p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong> may be defined as the degree of determination, drive, or desire with which an individual approaches (or avoids) a behavior.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a complete lack of motivation or a desire to engage in a certain behavior or activity is known as <strong>Amotivation</strong>.</p>
<p>Motivation is often categorized as either intrinsic or extrinsic:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intrinsic Motivation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Originates internally and refers to the motivation to perform a task for the inherent pleasure, enjoyment, satisfaction, or personal challenge</li>
<li>Since intrinsic motivation comes from within an individual, it is also called <strong>Internal Motivation</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Extrinsic Motivation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Driven by factors external to or outside of an individual such as financial incentives, awards, competition, approval from others, or recognition</li>
<li>Since extrinsic motivation originates from outside of the individual, it is also called <strong>External Motivation</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="motivation-continuum">Motivation Continuum<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#motivation-continuum">#</a></h3>
<p>The various types of motivation may be plotted on a continuum:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amotivation</strong> at one end</li>
<li><strong>Intrinsic Motivation</strong> at the other end</li>
<li><strong>Extrinsic Motivation</strong> in the middle</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod1/Motivation.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>At the left of the continuum, an <strong>amotivated</strong> individual lacks any desire or willingness to exercise.</p>
<p>Different <strong>regulators of Extrinsic Motivation</strong> also fall along a continuum:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External Regulation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Refers to extrinsic motivation driven by the desire to gain an external reward or to avoid an external punishment.</li>
<li>This falls to the far left within extrinsic motivation, just above amotivation.</li>
<li>For example, an individual may be motivated to exercise solely to earn a partial reimbursement of their monthly health club membership dues from their health insurance provider.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Introjected Regulation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Refers to extrinsic motivation arising from a sense of obligation or to avoid feelings of guilt.</li>
<li>For example, an individual may begin to exercise in response to pressure from a spouse or friend, or to satisfy the advice of their health care provider.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Identified Regulation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Is motivation driven by the desire to achieve a personal goal such weight loss or improved appearance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Regulation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Refers to motivation to engage a certain behavior in order to confirm one&rsquo;s sense of self.</li>
<li>For instance, an individual may run because they see themselves as a runner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intrinsic Motivation</strong> comes from within</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercising because it&rsquo;s pleasurable, satisfying, and one simply enjoys the act of exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving from left to right on this continuum, the probability that one will adhere to regular exercise increases, with intrinsically motivated individuals demonstrating the strongest long-term commitment to exercise.</p>

<h2 id="self-efficacy">Self-Efficacy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#self-efficacy">#</a></h2>
<p>Like motivation, the presence of self-efficacy is necessary for the adoption and maintenance of regular exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Self-efficacy</strong> is the is the extent to which an individual believes they will be successful in performing the desired behavior given the abilities they possess and the situation in which the find themselves. <em><strong>In other words, self-efficacy is situation-specific self-confidence.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Self-Efficacy Theory (SET)</strong>, introduced by psychologist Albert Bandura, proposes that <em>confidence in personal ability to carry out a behavior (e.g., physical activity/exercise) influences the direction, intensity, and persistence of that behavior</em>.</p>
<p>In the book, <em>Coaching for Performance</em>, the author, John Whitmore notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The single universal internal block that prevents individuals from achieving their potential is the same, and often referred to as fear of failure, lack of confidence, self-doubt, or lack of self-belief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Increasing self-efficacy with regard to physical activity and exercise is a critical step toward the successful adoption of a physically-active lifestyle.</p>
<h3 id="self-efficacy-theory">Self-Efficacy Theory<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#self-efficacy-theory">#</a></h3>
<p>A high level of self-efficacy is especially critical during the initial phases of change.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Efficacy</strong> influences the thoughts, feelings, and actions throughout the process of change.</p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of self-efficacy is central to many models and theories of behavior change.</li>
<li>There are several factors that may either increase or decrease an individual&rsquo;s self-efficacy with regard to a particular behavior such as physical activity or exercise.</li>
<li>Having knowledge of these factors helps the exercise professional to develop strategies intended to build one&rsquo;s self-efficacy toward exercise, dietary modification, or the adoption of other healthy behaviors.</li>

<p><em><strong>Self-Efficacy Influences:</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Past Performance and Mastery Experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree of success perceived or experienced by an individual who has previously engaged in activities similar to, or the same as, the current activity will influence their self-efficacy in the present time.</li>
<li>An individual may think to themselves, “I&rsquo;ve done it before, so I can do it again.”</li>
<li>Self-efficacy may also increase as an individual achieves short-term goals or accomplishes smaller steps toward a desired outcome.</li>
<li>As they experience success and master an activity or task, their self-efficacy grows.</li>
<li>Past performance and mastery experience are perhaps the factors most strongly associated to self-efficacy since these factors are based on one&rsquo;s own personal experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Modeling and Vicarious Experiences</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observing others or reading success stories or testimonials, especially of people having similar demographics and characteristics, can increase a person&rsquo;s self-efficacy related to exercise or the achievement of a specific goal such as weight loss.</li>
<li>In this case the individual may think to themselves, “If he or she can do it, then so can I.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Persuasion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Relates to verbal or nonverbal tactics used by others in an attempt to increase a person&rsquo;s self-efficacy and influence behavior.</li>
<li>Positive feedback and encouragement from a personal trainer or fitness instructor can have a significant influence on self-efficacy and motivation to adopt a new behavior (e.g., physical activity).</li>
<li>In many situations, people tend to raise themselves to the expectations of those who surround and influence them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stress Perception &amp; Physiological/Affective States</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced perceptions of stress as well as physiological and affective states also influence self-efficacy.</li>
<li>An individual&rsquo;s self-perception of his or her level of fitness is an important factor affecting self-efficacy.</li>
<li>Feelings of pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, or rapid heart rate associated with exercise may negatively impact self-efficacy when the individual perceives these physical responses to be representative of low fitness and their inability to sustain activity.</li>
<li>Emotional states can also exert both a positive or negative influence on self-efficacy.</li>
<li>Negative emotions such as fear, anxiety, sadness, disappointment, or frustration, typically reduce self-efficacy; whereas, positive emotions like happiness, pride, or exhilaration will increase self-efficacy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="transtheoretical-model">Transtheoretical Model<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#transtheoretical-model">#</a></h2>
<p><em>Transtheoretical Model (TTM) originally emerged in the late 1970s as the result of studies and observations regarding individuals attempting to overcome addictive behaviors such as smoking.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Since that time, this model (also referred to as the <strong>Stages of Change Model</strong>) has been applied to other types of behavioral change including the adoption of physical activity and exercise.</li>
<li>In fact, among all models and theories of behavioral change, the transtheoretical model is perhaps the most commonly cited with regard to increasing physical activity behavior.</li>
<li>The transtheoretical model is an important tool for developing strategies to guide individuals toward healthier behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stages-of-change">Stages of Change<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#stages-of-change">#</a></h3>
<p>According to this model, people go through distinct, predictable stages in the process of making lifestyle behavior changes.</p>
<p><em><strong>The model includes five specific stages of change:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Precontemplation</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>The stage in which the individual displays no intention to adopt physical activity or exercise in the near future.</em></li>
<li>These individuals are not thinking about change, do not recognize a need for change, and may even discount or ignore the benefits of making a change.</li>
<li>In some cases, individuals in the precontemplation stage may even become defensive if the need for physical activity is suggested by others.</li>
<li>At this stage, the person is thinking, “I won&rsquo;t” make this change.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Contemplation</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>People are considering physical activity or another lifestyle change.</em></li>
<li>Individuals have not yet adopted the new behavior; however, they are starting to weigh the benefits of regular activity with the negative implications of maintaining a sedentary lifestyle.</li>
<li>This internal process of considering the pros and cons of change is called <strong>decisional balance</strong>, which will be discussed in more detail.</li>
<li><em>Individuals in the contemplation stage often feel ambivalent to change, meaning they would like to make the change, but at the same time are content staying as they are.</em></li>
<li>Although thinking about it, they are not yet fully committed to making change.</li>
<li>At this stage, the person is thinking, “I may” become physically active or begin exercising, but then again, “I may not.”</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Preparation</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>The individual is ready to begin physical activity in the near future, usually the next 30 days, and is mentally and physically preparing for the new behavior.</em></li>
<li>In this case, the individual may even be performing some sporadic and infrequent exercise or leisure-time physical activity.</li>
<li>This stage is also characterized by preparatory actions such as setting goals, joining a health club, buying workout clothes, or scheduling a consultation with an exercise professional.</li>
<li>In the preparation stage, the individual is thinking, “I will” began physical activity or exercise in the very near future.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Action</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Clearly defined by the individual regularly performing physical activity; however, they have been engaged in this new behavior for less than 6 months.</em></li>
<li>In most cases, regular physical activity is defined according to the recommendations from the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, which is <em>a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity</em>, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week.</li>
<li>In the action stage, the individual can proudly state, “I am” regularly performing physical activity.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Maintenance Stage</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Attained once a habit of regular physical activity has been sustained for six months or longer</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relapse</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Refers to a point at which an individual falls back into an old habit or terminates performance of the new behavior.</li>
<li>Relapses are often preceded by a <strong>lapse,</strong> <em>which is a momentary or temporary departure from the desirable behavior.</em></li>
<li>For example, missing a day or perhaps a week of physical activity, then quickly returning to the regular routine.</li>
<li>A relapse is likely to cause the individual to move back to an earlier stage of change.</li>
<li>Although lapses are inevitable, with recognition and planning, a relapse may be avoided.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identifying-the-stage-of-change">Identifying the Stage of Change<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#identifying-the-stage-of-change">#</a></h3>
<p>Based on the definition for each stage of change in the transtheoretical model, Marcus &amp; Forsyth established a series of brief statements that may be used by fitness professionals to identify an individual&rsquo;s stage of change.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first two statements are “I am currently physically active”, and “I intend to become more physically active within the next 6 months.”
<ul>
<li>If the individual indicates “no” to each of these statements, then they are considered to be in the precontemplation stage.</li>
<li>If the individual indicates “no” to the first statement, yet responds “yes” to the second statement, then they are considered to be in the contemplation stage of change.</li>
<li>If the individual indicates “yes” to the first statement, then the second statement is not applicable.</li>
<li>If the individual indicates “no” to the third statement, “I currently engage in regular physical activity,” then this person is most likely in the preparation stage. Although the individual is active, their level of physical activity is not considered ‘regular' as defined by the table.</li>
<li>If the individual indicates “yes” to the first statement, then the second statement is again not applicable.</li>
<li>If the individual indicates “yes” to the third statement, but “no” to the final statement, then they are currently in the action stage.</li>
<li>Finally if the individual indicates “yes” to the first, the third, and the fourth statements, then they are identified as being in the maintenance stage of behavioral change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Having now successfully identified an individual&rsquo;s current stage of change, the personal trainer may proceed to develop and implement stage-specific strategies intended to facilitate movement of this individual to subsequent stages of change.</p>

<h2 id="goal-setting">Goal-Setting<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#goal-setting">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be very careful if you don&rsquo;t know where you are going, because you might not get there. - Yogi Berra</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An important step toward the adoption of regular physical activity or other positive lifestyle changes is to establish appropriate goals.</p>
<p>Well-designed goals can enhance motivation, increase self-efficacy, and improve adherence to an exercise program.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-goals">Types of Goals<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#types-of-goals">#</a></h3>
<p>Generally speaking, there are two broad categories of goals which include action-oriented and outcome-oriented goals.</p>
<p><strong>Action-Oriented Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Represent a behavior, or action, that will be performed in order to achieve a desired outcome.</li>
<li>Action-oriented goals are typically short-term in nature, and often represent an action to be performed on a daily or weekly basis.
<ul>
<li>A sample action-oriented goal statement is, “I will complete 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week.”</li>
<li>Another example is, “I will walk briskly for two miles on three days each week.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Action-oriented goals may also be referred to as <strong>process- or performance-oriented goals</strong> since they are often steps in a process or behaviors that are performed by an individual.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome-Oriented Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Represents the desired end result, or outcome, to be attained.</li>
<li>Outcome-oriented goals often require more time to achieve, therefore, these types of goals are often long-term.
<ul>
<li>A sample outcome-oriented goal is, “I will lose 10 pounds over the next two months.”</li>
<li>Another example, is “I will decrease my 5K race time to less than 24 minutes by the end of the summer.”</li>
<li>In both examples, the goal represents a desired outcome that will result from adherence to a specific exercise program spanning several months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is common for clients to express their goals in terms of an outcome they desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, it is the personal trainer&rsquo;s role to help identify a safe and effective plan or exercise program through which this outcome will be achieved.</li>
<li>As such, the personal trainer will help the client to focus on the achievement of established action-oriented goals that lead to the desired outcome.</li>
<li>When outcome-oriented goals are overemphasized, a client may become frustrated or discouraged if measurable progress is not achieved within what the client may perceive to be a realistic timeframe.</li>
<li>By re-focusing the client&rsquo;s attention on the accomplishment of action-oriented goals, motivation is sustained and self-efficacy increases.</li>
<li>In addition, since the client controls their own behavior, achieving short-term action-oriented goals fosters a sense of empowerment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="smart-goals">SMART Goals<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#smart-goals">#</a></h3>
<p>An effective goal-setting strategy is to establish SMART goals.</p>
<p><strong>SMART</strong> is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specific:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Establish clear, well-defined goals.</li>
<li>The goal must specifically indicate exactly what is to be accomplished.</li>
<li>The goal must be easily understood and unambiguous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Measurable:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The goal statement should include an objective method of measuring the progress toward and attainment of the goal.</li>
<li>A quantifiable measurement allows for easy tracking of progress toward the goal and a clear indication of goal achievement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Attainable:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A goal should be realistically attainable.</li>
<li>If the individual believes in their ability to accomplish the goal, then the individual will feel greater motivation and persevere over obstacles to attain the goal.</li>
<li>It is important for goal statements to be reasonably challenging; however, establishing goals that are obviously too lofty may cause frustration, discouragement, and demotivation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Relevant:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The goal should be relevant to the unique needs, interests, and abilities of the individual.</li>
<li>Action-oriented goals must correlate to the desired long-term outcome.</li>
<li>When a goal is relevant, the individual goal-seeker will buy into the goal, and be motivated to strive toward achievement.</li>
<li>As such, goal-setting must be a collaborative process including the client to ensure relevance to their interests and desires.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time-Bound:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Effective goal-statements identify the specific timeframe within which the goal is to be achieved.</li>
<li>Short-term action-oriented goals are often framed around an action or behavior to be performed on a daily or weekly basis.</li>
<li>Long-term outcome-oriented goals often designate a future date or deadline by which the goal will be achieved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that many variations of the SMART acronym do exist, with some similarities and some differences. Regardless of the goal-setting approach, it is obvious that successful behavior change is facilitated by well-defined goals.</p>
<h2 id="motivational-interviewing">Motivational Interviewing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#motivational-interviewing">#</a></h2>
<p>Motivational interviewing has been shown to be an effective approach to facilitate the adoption and maintenance of healthy lifestyle behaviors including physical activity. Motivational interviewing, or MI for short, was originally introduced in the early 1980s by psychologist, Dr. William Miller and further developed and described with his colleague Dr. Stephen Rollnick.</p>
<p>In the most recent edition of their popular book, <em>Motivational Interviewing: Helping People Change</em>, Miller and Rollnick (2013) offer several definitions of motivational interviewing. The layperson&rsquo;s definition of motivational interviewing states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Motivational interviewing is a collaborative conversation style for strengthening a person&rsquo;s own motivation and commitment to change.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miller and Rollnick (2013) also provide a more technical definition which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Motivational interviewing is a collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change. It is designed to strengthen personal motivation for, and commitment to, a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the person&rsquo;s own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Motivational interviewing has become central to the strategies used by health &amp; wellness coaches to guide their clients through the process of behavioral change. MI is also gaining popularity among exercise professionals as a method to help clients adopt and maintain healthy lifestyle behaviors. In the book, <em>Motivational Interviewing in Nutrition and Fitness</em>, authors Clifford and Curtis (2016) note, <em>“Clients typically know what they should do with regard to eating and physical activity, but there are many reasons why they don&rsquo;t.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Motivational interviewing is a client-centered, yet goal-oriented method for helping people to resolve ambivalence about health behavior change by evoking intrinsic motivation and strengthening commitment to change.</p>
<h3 id="the-spirit-of-mi-pace">The Spirit of MI (PACE)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-spirit-of-mi-pace">#</a></h3>
<p>The underlying spirit of motivational interviewing affects every aspect of how you interact with a client, including both verbal and nonverbal communication.</p>
<p><em><strong>Spirit of MI includes: Partnership, Acceptance, Compassion, and Evocation.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Partnership</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first of four aspects of the spirit of MI is that it involves partnership.</li>
<li>MI is done ‘for' and ‘with' a person.</li>
<li>It is an active collaboration between experts.</li>
<li>The client is the undisputed expert on themselves.</li>
<li>When using MI, the exercise professional is a companion who typically does less than half of the talking.</li>
<li>MI is like dancing rather than wrestling.</li>
<li>One person moves with rather than against the other person.</li>
<li>The exercise professional must willingly suspend the reflexive urge to provide expert advise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Related to this spirit of partnership is an attitude of profound acceptance of the client.</li>
<li>Acceptance has been described as including four aspects:
<ul>
<li>First, acceptance involves recognizing and appreciating the inherent <strong>absolute worth</strong> and potential of every human being.</li>
<li>A second key aspect of acceptance is <strong>accurate empathy</strong>, an active interest in and effort to understand the other&rsquo;s internal perspective, to see the world through his or her eyes.</li>
<li>Third, acceptance involves <strong>autonomy support</strong>. In other words, honoring and respecting each person&rsquo;s autonomy, their irrevocable right and capacity of self-direction and independence.</li>
<li>Finally, acceptance involves <strong>affirmation</strong>, to seek and acknowledge the person&rsquo;s strengths and efforts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compassion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, to be compassionate is to actively promote the client&rsquo;s welfare and to give priority to their needs.</li>
<li>Compassion is a deliberate commitment to pursue and support the best interests of the client.</li>
<li>To work with a spirit of compassion is to have your heart in the right place so that the trust you engender will be deserved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evocation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Whereas many assessments and evaluations are often focused on detecting deficits to be addressed by the exercise professional, the spirit of MI starts from a very different strengths-focused premise, that people already have within them much of the knowledge and skill that is needed for change.</li>
<li>In this regard, the role of the exercise professional is to evoke this intrinsic knowledge regarding how to change.</li>
<li>The personal trainer brings their expertise about exercise science, program design, and how to perform specific exercises, but the client must uncover their own why and want to perform the exercise program.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="core-principles-of-mi">Core Principles of MI<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#core-principles-of-mi">#</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the underlying spirit, there are several core principles that guide motivational interviewing.</p>
<p><strong>Express Empathy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The personal trainer demonstrates respect for and acceptance of the client and their feelings, encourages a nonjudgmental and collaborative relationship, uses active listening techniques, and recognizes that ambivalence to behavior change is normal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Develop Discrepancy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Change is motivated by a perceived discrepancy between one&rsquo;s present behavior and important personal goals and values.</li>
<li>The client rather than the personal trainer, should present the arguments in favor of change, known as ‘change talk'.</li>
<li>The personal trainer helps to recognize discrepancies and draws the client&rsquo;s attention to them.</li>
<li>One way to enhance a client&rsquo;s motivation for change is to help him or her recognize a discrepancy or gap between future goals and current behavior.</li>
<li>When people see that their actions conflict with important personal values such as health, success, or family happiness, change is more likely to occur.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roll with Resistance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid arguing for change, new perspectives are invited not imposed, the client is the primary source of answers and solutions to adopt a new behavior.</li>
<li>Resistance is a signal to respond with a different approach.</li>
<li>Also, recognize ambivalence: the client may not resist change, but may simply display indifference to change.</li>
<li>The personal trainer needs to explore with questions to identify what area of the client&rsquo;s health behaviors they agree need to change and that the need for change is important enough to discuss.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support Self-Efficacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The client&rsquo;s belief in the possibility of change is a strong motivator, the personal trainer&rsquo;s belief in the client becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</li>
<li>Communicate belief in the client&rsquo;s capacity to achieve their goals.</li>
<li>Remember, positive social persuasion can strengthen self-efficacy toward exercise or healthy eating.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Avoid Argumentation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Power struggles between a personal trainer and a client do not enhance motivation for change.</li>
<li>The goal is to accompany clients through behavioral change, not force or drag them along.</li>
<li>In the long-term, trying to convince a client to exercise or eat healthy foods is largely ineffective.</li>
<li>Pushing a client to make a change often backfires, causing the client to dig in their heels and avoid change.</li>

<p>Motivational interviewing involves four key processes: engaging, focusing, evoking, and planning.</p>
<p><strong>Engaging</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first of these processes.</li>
<li><em>Establish rapport, mutual trust, and a respectful helping relationship.</em></li>
<li>Questions to ask yourself may include:
<ul>
<li>How comfortable is this person talking to me?</li>
<li>How comfortable do I feel in this conversation?</li>
<li>How supportive and helpful am I being?</li>
<li>Does this feel like a collaborative partnership?</li>
<li>Do I understand this person&rsquo;s perspective and concerns?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Focusing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Identify and maintain a specific direction in the motivational interviewing conversation about change.</em></li>
<li>Questions to ask yourself may include:
<ul>
<li>What goals for change does this person really have?</li>
<li>Do I have a clear sense of where we are going?</li>
<li>Does it feel like we are moving together, not in different directions?</li>
<li>Does this feel more like dancing or wrestling?</li>
<li>Are we working together with a common purpose?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evoking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The process of discovering the client&rsquo;s own motivation for change, assisting clients to overcome their ambivalence to change, guiding clients to recognize discrepancies between their current behavior and their broader life goals or values, and to elicit client statements in favor change, again such statements are known as “change talk”.</em></li>
<li>Questions to think to yourself may include:
<ul>
<li>What are the person&rsquo;s own reasons for change?</li>
<li>Is the reluctance more about confidence or importance for change?</li>
<li>What ‘change talk' am I hearing?</li>
<li>Is my personal knowledge pulling me to be the one arguing for change?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Planning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>which encompasses <em>developing commitment to change</em> and formulating a specific action plan.</li>
<li>Questions for yourself may include:
<ul>
<li>What would be a reasonable next step toward change?</li>
<li>Am I remembering to evoke rather than prescribe a plan?</li>
<li>What would help this person to move forward?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The final aspect of MI brings us full circle back to effective communication discussed in section two.</p>
<p>There are four core communication skills that are important in engaging and throughout the process of motivational interviewing.</p>
<p>Taken together, these skills form the acronym O.A.R.S.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Questions that do not limit an individual&rsquo;s response and invite elaboration; often uncovering more subjective and emotionally-based thoughts such as personal opinions, feelings, and beliefs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Affirming</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Statements that accentuate the positive; to affirm is to recognize and acknowledge that which is good including the individual&rsquo;s inherent strengths and worth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reflecting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Re-stating the client&rsquo;s statements to confirm understanding, validate assumptions, thoughts or feelings, and to enable the client to ‘see' themselves in a new way.</li>
<li><em>Refer back to various types of reflection statements covered in section two.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Summarizing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A reflective statement that pulls together several ideas or thoughts communicated by the client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a motivational interviewing approach and active listening skills, the personal trainer is much more likely to help their clients to adopt and maintain lifelong healthy living habits.</p>
