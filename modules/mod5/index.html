  "articleBody": "Section 1: Intro to Physical Activity \u0026 Principles of Exercise Section one of this module provides an introduction to physical activity and principles of exercise:\n the well-documented benefits of regular physical activity the physical activity recommendations for improved health components of health-related physical fitness principles of exercise training  Key Terms According to the World Health Organization, health does not merely represent the absence of disease, but also reflects a state of optimal physical, social, and psychological well-being.\n Health is impacted by many interrelated factors such as the environment, genetics, socioeconomic status, and modifiable lifestyle behaviors such as nutrition and physical activity. The state of one’s health falls somewhere on a continuum with positive and negative poles:  Positive health is associated with the capacity to enjoy life, withstand challenges, and avoid illness and disease. Negative health is associated with illness, chronic disease, and premature death.    Physical activity has been defined as any bodily movement produced by the use of skeletal muscles that increases energy expenditure above the resting level.\n Physical activity is comprised of 4 major domains:  domestic physical activity  yard work, household chores, and child care   transportation physical activity  walking or biking   occupational physical activity  all work-related activities   leisure-time physical activity  recreation, sports, and exercise exercise is defined as planned, structured, and repetitive bodily movement performed to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness, such as cardiorespiratory or aerobic exercise, resistance training exercise, and flexibility exercises such as stretching      Physical fitness is a set of attributes possessed or attained by an individual that contribute to the ability to perform physical activity with vigor and without undue fatigue.\nThe health-related components of physical fitness include:\n cardiorespiratory endurance body composition muscular strength muscular endurance flexibility  Health Benefits of Physical Activity Countless scientific and epidemiologic research studies provide an overwhelming body of evidence regarding the many health benefits associated with regular physical activity. Although physical activity and exercise do present some risks, for the vast majority of individuals, the long-term health benefits of a physically active lifestyle far outweigh the potential acute risks.\nFor adults, there is strong scientific evidence to support the health benefits of physical activity including:\n Reduces the risk of all-cause premature death Reduces the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke Reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes Reduces the risk of high blood pressure (i.e., hypertension) Lowers blood pressure in people who already have hypertension Reduces the risk of developing colon cancer and breast cancer Reduces feelings of depression and anxiety Helps to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight Helps build and maintain healthy bones, muscles, and joints Improves cardiorespiratory endurance Promotes psychological well-being and improved cognitive function  The benefits of regular physical activity are indisputable. As stated by Booth and colleagues:\n “Indeed, with the possible exception of diet modifications, we know of no single intervention with greater promise than physical exercise to reduce the risk of virtually all chronic diseases, simultaneously.”\n Public Health Physical Activity Recommendations The health benefits of physical activity have been promoted for several decades. Among the first population-based physical activity recommendations were those jointly published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine in 1995. This consensus statement recommended:\n “Every US adult should accumulate 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days of the week.\"\n Shortly thereafter, a very similar recommendation was stated in Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon General. This recommendation indicated:\n  “Significant health benefits can be obtained by including a moderate amount of physical activity on most, if not all, days of the week. Through a modest increase in daily activity, most Americans can improve their health and quality of life.\"\n  In 2007, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Heart Association (AHA) updated the physical activity recommendations for adults. The primary recommendation of this report states:\n   “To promote and maintain health, all healthy adults aged 18 to 65 years need moderate-intensity aerobic (endurance) physical activity for a minimum of 30 minutes on five days each week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 minutes on three days each week. Combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet this recommendation.\"\n   2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans In recognition of the strong scientific evidence demonstrating a positive association between physical activity and health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.*\nThe content of the Physical Activity Guidelines is intended to complement the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (see chapter 9). Together these two publications provide direction to policymakers and health professionals regarding the promotion of physical activity and healthy dietary practices. The PAGA include guidelines for adults as well as other groups within the population including children and adolescents, older adults, women during pregnancy and the postpartum period, adults with disabilities, and people with chronic medical conditions.\nThe key physical activity guidelines are as follows:\nAll adults should avoid inactivity\n  Some physical activity is better than none, and adults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits\n  For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least:\n 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous- intensity aerobic activity Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes, and preferably, it should be spread throughout the entire week    For additional and more extensive health benefits, adults should increase their aerobic physical activity to:\n 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity or 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond this amount    Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that are moderate- or high-intensity and involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits\n  The second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines is scheduled to be released in late 2018. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee is responsible for reviewing the body of scientific and medical evidence in physical activity and health. Using this evidence, the Advisory Committee will prepare a scientific report that documents the background and rationale for its recommendations for the second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. For more information regarding the development of the forthcoming 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines, please visit the health.gov website.\nRelative and Absolute Physical Activity Intensity The recommendations and guidelines for physical activity utilize terms such as moderate- and vigorous-intensity.\nThe two primary approaches to define and monitor the intensity of physical activity include relative intensity and absolute intensity:\n  Relative Intensity\n based on the level of individual effort required to perform a certain activity synonymous to Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE), which will be discussed further in the next section of this module generally speaking, less fit individuals require a subjectively higher level of effort than well-conditioned individuals to perform the same activity the relative intensity or effort can be estimated using a scale from 0 to 10  sitting quietly resting is 0 and the maximal possible effort is 10 moderate-intensity is equivalent to a rating of 5 or 6 vigorous-intensity is equivalent to a rating of 7 or 8      Absolute Intensity\n Physical Activity Guidelines have been established based on absolute intensity since scientific research largely demonstrates that the health benefits of physical activity are dependent upon the total weekly amount of energy expended measured by Metabolic Equivalent (MET)  the unit of measurement used to define the absolute energy expenditure of a specific activity 1 MET is the rate of energy expenditure during an activity (i.e., activity metabolic rate) divided by the rate of energy expenditure at rest (i.e., resting metabolic rate) 1 MET is equal to an oxygen consumption of approximately 3.5 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute moderate-intensity physical activity corresponds to a MET value of 3.0 to 5.9 vigorous intensity physical activity corresponds to a MET value greater than or equal to 6.0     Absolute Physical Activity Intensity      Resting 1 MET   Light Intensity 1.1 to 2.9 METs   Moderate Intensity 3.0 to 5.9 METs   Vigorous Intensity ≥ 6.0 METs        Understanding METs Metabolic Equivalent (MET) is an estimate of intensity based on the ratio of exercise metabolic rate to resting metabolic rate\n 1 MET is equivalent to an oxygen uptake of 3.5 mL/kg/min and represents the resting oxygen consumption  VO2rest = 3.5 mL/kg/min = 1 MET (metabolic equivalent) Physical activity performed at 2 METs requires twice the resting oxygen consumption, 3 METs equals three times rest, and so on…    Compendium of Physical Activities has been established as a resource to estimate and classify the energy costs of various physical activities. The Compendium includes a comprehensive list of physical activities and their respective MET values for 21 major categories of activities.\nCalculating relative oxygen consumption:\n Using the MET value for a particular physical activity, the relative oxygen consumption may be calculated:  For example, according to the Compendium of Physical Activities, walking at 3 miles per hour and 1% grade is equivalent to an intensity of 5.3 METs:  5.3 METs x 3.5 mL/kg/min = 18.6 mL/kg/min therefore the relative oxygen consumption necessary to perform this activity is 18.6 mL/kg/min      Converting relative oxygen consumption into METs:\n Likewise, if an individual’s relative oxygen consumption is measured or calculated during a specific activity, then the intensity of this activity may be converted to METs:  For example, a client’s oxygen consumption while running on a treadmill is measured as 36.8 mL/kg/min:  36.8 mL/kg/min ÷ 5.3 METs = 10.5 METs this is equivalent to approximately 10.5 METs      Sample Calculations   A participant is walking briskly on a treadmill at 4.2 mph with 3% grade. The display panel indicates the participant is exercising at 7.2 METs. What is the estimated relative oxygen consumption for this participant?\n 7.2 METs x 3.5 mL/kg/min = 25.2 mL/kg/min    What is the appropriate classification of physical activity performed at 7.2 METs?\n According to the classification system presented previously, physical activity greater or equal to 6 METs is vigorous, therefore physical activity performed at 7.2 is classified as vigorous-intensity.    Based on the Rockport One Mile Walk Test, a client’s maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) is estimated to be 34.2 mL/kg/min. What is this client’s estimated maximal MET capacity?\n 34.2 mL/kg/min ÷ 3.5 mL/kg/min = 9.8 METs    Health-Related Components of Physical Fitness The five components of health-related physical fitness include:\n Cardiorespiratory Endurance  the capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to the working muscles during continuous aerobic physical activity, expressed as maximal oxygen consumption or VO2max   Body Composition  the relative amount of fat mass and lean body mass throughout the body, and is expressed as a percent body fat   Muscular Strength  the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to exert a maximum force against an external load, often expressed in terms of one-repetition maximum weight lifted for a specific exercise   Muscular Endurance  the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to repeatedly exert submaximal force against a resistance over a period of time, typically quantified as the maximal number of repetitions performed during a specific exercise   Flexibility  the ability to move through a full, pain-free range of motion, often measured in degrees or distance moved in a particular direction    Principles of Exercise Training Inherent to any exercise program is the objective to improve health as well as develop one or more components of physical fitness.\nThe stimulus provided by an exercise program causes a training effect, which refers to the physiological and physical adaptations resulting from exercise.\nThere are several underlying principles of training which are characteristic of any exercise program and are influential upon the training effect, which include:\n overload progression specificity variation  Overload Principle of Overload refers to the application of a physiologic or physical stress greater than that to which the body, system, or targeted tissue is normally subjected.\n This greater-than-normal stress may be applied through any number of variables including an increase in exercise intensity, duration, or volume, as well as choice of exercise or manipulation of rest periods.  Progression Principle of Progression indicates that as the system and/or tissue adapts and becomes accustomed to the current stress, the training stimulus must be increased in order to apply sufficient overload for additional adaptation and improvement.\n To minimize the risk of injury, the magnitude of the progression must be gradual and appropriate to the health status, level of fitness, and capabilities of the participant.  Specificity Principle of Specificity indicates that the physiologic and physical adaptations in response to the overload are specific to the type of “stress” and the manner in which it is applied to the body.\n In other words, the training effect is specific to the training stimulus. The principle of specificity is also referred to as the S.A.I.D. Principle:  Specific Adaptations to Imposed Demands    Variation Principle of Variation is described by the planned, strategic, and meaningful changes or variety within an exercise program.\n Variety may be created by the choice of exercise modality or through alterations of other acute training variables such as intensity, duration, or volume of exercise. In addition, variety is also important to maintain participant interest, motivation, and adherence to an exercise program.  Each of these principles, as well as others, will be addressed in more detail in the upcoming sections of this module.\n Section 2: Cardiorespiratory Programming Cardiorespiratory Endurance is defined as the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to the muscles during sustained physical activity or exercise.\nThe training stimulus necessary to increase cardiorespiratory endurance is provided by exercise that is primarily aerobic in nature and involves the use of large muscle groups in a rhythmic and continuous manner.\nSection two will present guidelines and programming considerations with regard to cardiorespiratory exercise (CRE) training.\nElements of a CRE Workout An individual session of cardiorespiratory exercise includes three elements:\n warm-up conditioning a cool-down  Warm-Up The warm-up serves to prepare the body physically, physiologically, and psychologically for the relatively higher intensity exercise that will be performed during the conditioning phase of the session.\n A typical warm-up consists of at least 5 to 10 minutes of light- to moderate-intensity aerobic activity gradually progressing to the intensity to be sustained during the conditioning phase.  Conditioning The conditioning phase of the session provides the primary training stimulus to increase cardiorespiratory endurance.\n The conditioning phase typically represents 20 to 60 minutes of the session during which aerobic-type exercise is performed. This may include exercises such as walking, jogging, running, cycling, elliptical training, stair climbing, rowing, and any other mode of exercise that is primarily aerobic in nature and involves the use of large muscle groups in a rhythmic and continuous manner.  Cool-Down The cool-down follows the conditioning phase of the exercise session.\n Similar to the warm-up, the cool-down consists of 5 to 10 minutes of light- to moderate-intensity aerobic activity. In addition, the cool-down is often concluded with flexibility exercises.  The purpose of the cool-down is to allow for the gradual return of cardiorespiratory systems back toward pre-exercise levels, as seen by a decrease in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration, and to facilitate the removal of metabolic byproducts from the skeletal muscles.\nObjectives of the Warm-up The physiologic and psychologic objectives and benefits of the warm-up include:\n Allows for a gradual metabolic adaptation, such as increased oxygen uptake, which enhances cardiorespiratory performance. Prevents premature onset of blood lactate accumulation and undue fatigue during higher-intensity exercise. Reduces the oxygen deficit observed at the onset of exercise. Causes a gradual increase in muscle temperature which decreases the work of contraction and reduces the likelihood of muscle injury. Facilitates better neural transmission and motor unit recruitment. Improves coronary blood flow and lessens the potential for myocardial ischemia. Allows gradual redistribution of blood flow to the exercising muscle. Increases the elasticity of the connective tissues and other muscle components. Provides psychological preparation for higher levels of exercise, increases arousal, motivation, and focus.  Objectives of the Cool-down The objectives and benefits of the cool-down include:\n Prevents post-exercise venous blood pooling. Reduces potential for sudden drop in blood pressure (hypotension), thereby reducing the likelihood of post-exercise lightheadedness and fainting. Ensures continued adequate circulation to the skeletal muscles, heart, and brain. Reduces immediate post-exercise tendency for muscle spasm and cramping. Reduces the concentration of exercise hormones, such as norepinephrine, thereby lowering the probability of post-exercise disturbances in cardiac rhythm. May mitigate the severity and duration of delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS).  FITT Guidelines for CRE Programs designed to increase cardiorespiratory endurance include the variables:\n Frequency Intensity Time Type of exercise  This collection of variables is often referred to as the FITT Principle.\nFrequency Frequency of exercise refers to the number of days per week that aerobic exercise is to be performed.\n This answers the question, “How often should I exercise?” For most adults to achieve and maintain health and fitness benefits, it is recommended;  moderate-intensity exercise is performed at least 5 days per week, or vigorous intensity exercise is performed at least 3 days per week, or a range of 3 to 5 days per week including a combination of both moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise    Intesity Intensity of cardiorespiratory exercise answers the question, “How hard should I exercise?”\n Presently, it is recommended that most adults perform:  moderate- and/or vigorous-intensity exercise however, very deconditioned individuals may place initial focus on light- to moderate-intensity exercise   Several methods exist to establish and monitor exercise intensity, such as heart rate and rating of perceived exertion The specific parameters pertaining to the various method that may be used to monitor exercise intensity will be presented in the next section  Time Time, or duration of exercise, answers the question, “How long should I exercise?”\n Cardiorespiratory exercise may be performed:  continuously during one session or accumulated throughout the day in intermittent bouts each lasting a minimum of 10 minutes   It is recommended to accumulate:  30 to 60 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, 20 to 60 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise each day    Type Type, or mode of exercise, answers the question, “What kind of exercise should I perform?”\n Rhythmic, aerobic exercise that involves large muscle groups and requires little skill to perform is recommended for all adults to improve health and cardiorespiratory fitness Certainly, a wide variety of options are available with regard to the type of cardiorespiratory exercise Personal preferences, physical limitations, and equipment availability are among the factors likely to influence the choice of exercise  Determining and Monitoring Exercise Intensity Parameters of Exercise Intensity This table summarizes the recommended ranges, as defined by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), for each method used to monitor exercise intensity and the corresponding categories or descriptors including light, moderate, vigorous, and near-maximal to maximal exercise.\n   Descriptor %HRR/VO2R %HRmax %VO2max RPE (6-20 scale) RPE (0-10 scale) METs     Light 30 - 39 57 - 63 37 - 45 9 - 11 2 - 4 2.0 - 2.9   Moderate 40 - 59 64 - 76 46 - 63 12 - 13 5 - 6 3.0 - 5.9   Vigorous 60 - 89 77 - 95 64 - 90 14 - 17 7 - 8 6.0 - 8.7   Near-maximal to Maximal ≥ 90 ≥ 96 ≥ 91 18 - 20 9-10 ≥ 8.8    The most common methods used to monitor exercise intensity:\n Heart Rate Reserve percentage Maximal Heart Rate percentage Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) using the category-ratio scale from 0 to 10 Metabolic Equivalents (METs)  To improve overall health and cardiorespiratory fitness, it is recommended that most adults exercise at a moderate- and/or vigorous-intensity.\n For example, most adults will exercise at an intensity corresponding to  40 to 89% of heart rate reserve 64 to 95% of maximum heart rate RPE from 5 to 8 MET level of 3.0 to 8.7   Within these parameters, it is important advise clients to exercise at a specific intensity that is safe and appropriate to their personal goals, health status, level of fitness, physical limitations, and motivation as well as the objective for a particular bout of exercise.   Maximal Heart Rate Method (HRmax) Historically, one of the most common approaches to monitor exercise intensity in the fitness setting is the maximal heart rate (HRmax) method. This method utilizes maximal heart rate as the anchor point from which the target heart rate (THR) is calculated as a straight percentage of the HRmax.\nNumerous formulas have been developed to estimate age-predicted maximum heart rate among various populations. Perhaps the most frequently used equation to estimate maximum heart rate is 220 minus age, which was proposed by Fox and colleagues in 1971. Given the simplicity and prevalent use of this “220 - age” formula, we will utilize this prediction equation when presenting sample target heart rate calculations:\n 220 - age = HRmax HRmax x Desired % = Target Heart Rate (THR)  For example, using the maximal heart rate method, what is the target heart rate for a 35-year-old client wishing to exercise at 75% of their maximum heart rate?\n  Step 1: Calculate the age-predicted maximum heart rate by subtracting the age of 35 years from 220, which equals an estimated maximum heart rate of 185 beats per minute:\n 220 - age = HRmax 220 - 35 = 185 HRmax    Step 2: Calculate the target heart rate by multiplying the maximum heart rate by the desired 75%, which equals a target heart rate of 139 beats per minute:\n HRmax x Desired % = Target Heart Rate (THR) 185 x 0.75 = 139 b/min THR     Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) method is another approach to determine the target heart rate.\nThis method was first introduced by the physiologist, Dr. M.J. Karvonen and has therefore come to be known as the Karvonen Formula.\n  Step 1: The calculation of target heart rate begins with the standard “220 - age” to estimate maximum heart rate:\n 220 - age = HRmax    Step 2: The next step is to calculate the heart rate reserve, which is the difference between the maximum heart rate and the resting heart rate, so HRmax minus resting heart rate equals heart rate reserve:\n HRmax - RHR = HRR    Step 3: The heart rate reserve is multiplied by the desired training percentage, and then the resting heart rate is added back in to obtain the target heart rate:\n HRR x Desired % + RHR = Target Heart Rate (THR)    For example: What is the target heart rate for a 35-year-old client with a resting heart rate of 65 wishing to exercise at 70% of heart rate reserve?\n  Step One: Determine the age-predicted maximum heart rate by subtracting the age of 35 from 220, which equals 185:\n 220 - age = HRmax 220 - 35 = 185 HRmax    Step Two: - Determine the heart rate reserve by subtracting the resting heart rate of 65 from the maximum heart rate of 185, which equals a heart rate reserve of 120:\n HRmax - RHR = HRR 185 - 65 = 120 HRR    Step Three: Calculate the target heart rate by multiplying the heart rate reserve by the desired 70%, then add the resting heart rate back in to obtain the client’s target heart rate, which in this case is 149 beats per minute:\n HRR x Desired % + RHR = Target Heart Rate (THR) 120 x 0.70 + 65 = 149 b/min THR     Limitations of Age-Predicted HRmax The simplicity of the 220-age prediction equation has likely contributed to its widespread use among fitness professionals despite the many research studies that have noted a significant margin of error among maximum heart rate values derived from this formula.\nIt has been reported that the margin of error for this formula is plus or minus 10 beats per minute.\nMeaning for any age, the actual maximum heart rate for 1 standard deviation representing 68% of the population is within 10 beats above or 10 beats below the calculated maximum heart rate.\nFor example, the maximum heart rate for a 40-year-old is calculated to be 180 beats per minute, but in reality 68% of all 40-year-olds will have a true maximum heart rate between 170 and 190 beats per minute and 95% of the population, representing 2 standard deviations will have a true maximum heart rate between 160 and 200 beats per minute.\nA directly measured maximum heart rate obtained during a maximal graded exercise test provides the greatest accuracy.\nHowever, when this is not feasible or safe, methods to estimate maximum heart rate are acceptable.\nSeveral other regression equations have been developed, some of which may offer more precision in comparison to the 220-age formula.\nThe accuracy of each equation will be greatest when applied to individuals having characteristics similar to the study group from which the equation was developed.\nThe formula developed by Gellish and colleagues (2007) has been noted as providing greater accuracy:\n 206.9 - (0.67 x age) = HRmax   Rating of Perceived Exertion Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) was first introduced by Gunnar Borg and has since become widely used in a variety of fitness and clinical exercise settings.\n RPE provides a subjective indication regarding the difficulty of the exercise being performed by the participant.  Category Scale The original RPE scale, known as the Category Scale, includes a 15-point range of values from 6 to 20, which was intended to loosely correspond to heart rates ranging from 60 to 200 beats per minute.\n moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity and exercise, which is recommended for most adults, ranges from 12 to 17 on the category scale.    Category-Ratio Scale More recently, a revised rating of perceived exertion scale, known as the Category-Ratio Scale, was introduced. This revised scale provides a range of values from 0 to 10.\n moderate-intensity corresponds to a rating of 5 to 6 vigorous-intensity corresponds to a rating of 7 to 8  The category-ratio scale has gained popularity due to its relative simplicity, which allows for ease of use and understanding by lay persons and fitness professionals.\n  OMNI Picture System Based on the concept of Borg’s category-ratio scale, Robertson (2004) developed the OMNI Picture System for perceived exertion. Although the OMNI scale was originally developed for use with children, it has since been adapted for use with adults performing a variety of exercise modalities.\n      Steady State v. Interval Training The foundation of cardiorespiratory endurance is a well-developed aerobic base.\nAerobic base is often defined as the level at which the body utilizes fat most efficiently as a substrate for energy production during aerobic (i.e., oxygen-dependent) exercise.\nSteady State The aerobic base is initially developed through steady state exercise sessions. For most individuals seeking the health and general fitness benefits of cardiorespiratory exercise, this is the primary training strategy.\nDuring steady state exercise, a moderate-intensity is sustained at a fairly constant level over a continuous period of time.\nFor example, following an appropriate 10-minute warm-up, the exercise intensity may be increased to the level eliciting a heart rate equivalent to 70% of HRmax, which is sustained for 30 minutes followed by a 5-minute cool-down period.\n  Interval Training Having established a solid aerobic base through regular steady state exercise, interval training may also be used as an effective strategy to further increase cardiorespiratory endurance (i.e., VO2max) and anaerobic threshold.\nAn interval training session involves:\n a series of relatively short vigorous-intensity bouts of exercise, called work intervals, which are alternated with low-intensity active recovery intervals during the work interval, the exercise intensity is quickly elevated above the anaerobic threshold, typically 85% to 95% of HRmax, for approximately 10 seconds to 3 minutes this bout of vigorous-intensity exercise is immediately followed by an active recovery interval performed at 50% to 60% of HRmax each pair of work and recovery intervals is called a cycle each interval cycle is expressed as a ratio of work-to-recovery (work:recovery) for example, a work interval lasting for 45 seconds followed by a 90 second recovery is expressed as a 1:2 work-to-recovery ratio  The duration of the work interval and the ratio of work-to-recovery are based on many factors such as the participant’s level of fitness, motivation, and fitness goal, as well as the desired training effect.\nA very short interval (e.g., 10 to 20 seconds) will stimulate a training effect specific to the phosphagen system; whereas, relatively longer intervals (e.g., 30 seconds to 3 minutes) will lead to adaptations within the anaerobic glycolysis energy system.\nThe intensity of the work interval and work-to-recovery ratios should allow for 5 to 8 cycles to be completed within a workout.\n  For example, a 40-minute interval workout:\n beginning with a 10-minute warm-up followed by seven cycles of 1-minute work and 2 minutes 30 seconds recovery concluding with a 5 to 7 minute cool-down       Section 3: Muscular Fitness Programming Section three will review topics related to muscular fitness programming including:\n benefits of and adaptations to resistance training guidelines for resistance training program design acute training variables several resistance training program models concept of periodization  Benefits of Resistance Training A significant body of scientific evidence demonstrates the many benefits of regular resistance training. Many of these health benefits are similar to those observed with regular cardiorespiratory exercise, yet some are unique benefits specific to resistance training.\n The mechanical loading applied to the bones during resistance training provides a stimulus to increase bone mineral density and subsequently lowers the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Among older adults, resistance training also reduces the risk of falling and injuries sustained from falls. This is attributed to improved neuromuscular coordination and balance resulting from regular resistance training among all age categories. Resistance training decreases the risk of non-exercise-related injuries, and may reduce the risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis. Resistance training enhances athletic performance and preserves or increases functional capacity to perform activities of daily living as well as maintenance of independence and quality of life among aging adults. Finally, regular muscle-building activities increase lean body mass resulting in improved body composition and resting metabolic rate.  Training Adaptations Regular resistance training will result in one or more overarching adaptations, which are specific to the nature of the training stimulus applied to the body.\n  Muscular Endurance (local muscular endurance)\n the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to exert repeated contractions against a submaximal resistance over time local muscular endurance is developed by lifting a relatively light resistance for a high number of repetitions    Muscular Strength (maximal muscular strength)\n the maximal amount of force a muscle or group of muscles can generate during a specific movement at a specific velocity maximal muscular strength is developed by lifting heavy weights for a low number of repetitions    Hypertrophy\n the increase in the cross-sectional area of a muscle fiber (and the overall muscle size) resulting from an increase in the contractile proteins actin and myosin hypertrophy is developed though resistance training programs involving both intensity and volume overload    Power\n the rate of performing work calculated as force times distance divided by time since the distance a weight can be moved is often limited by limb length, power is increased by  increasing the speed (reduced time) or increasing the resistance   therefore, power is developed by  increasing the speed of movement, or lifting a heavier resistance with the same or greater movement speed than one would use with a lighter resistance      Quick Review Muscle Actions and Principles of Training Muscle Actions Let’s take a moment to quickly review the types of muscle actions presented in section one of module two:\n  Concentric\n the phase of an isotonic resistance training exercise during which the muscle shortens as the external resistance is lifted also called the positive phase    Eccentric\n the phase of an isotonic resistance training exercise during which the muscle lengthens as the external resistance is lowered, in a controlled manner against gravity also called the negative phase    Remember, when performing a resistance training exercise with a fixed weight such as a dumbbell, barbell, or plates on a selectorized machine, the weight always\n moves up during the concentric phase and down during the eccentric phase    Isometric\n a muscle action during which force is produced, but no movement occurs and the length of the muscle does not change    Principles of Training Principle of Progressive Overload An essential element to any exercise program is the application of sufficient overload.\n  Principle of Overload\n Indicates that in order to stimulate muscles to adapt, the targeted muscle or group of muscles must be subjected to a “stress” (e.g., weight, workload, training stimulus) greater than that which is normally encountered Overload is often thought of in terms of resistance applied to the muscle during an exercise, but overload may also arise from repetitions or overall volume of training Gains in muscular fitness will continue as long as the training stimulus remains effective, which requires increasing the “stress” in some manner such as the resistance, repetitions, or volume    Principle of Progression\n Indicates that as the muscles adapt to the current “stress”, the workload must be gradually progressed in order to stimulate further adaptation and improvement*    Overload and progression are closely tied to one another. Often times these principles are stated together as the Principle of Progressive Overload.\n Progressive overload is illustrated nicely by the fable of Milo of Croton…   Nearly 2,500 years ago, there was a man of incredible strength and athleticism roaming the hills of southern Italy. His name was Milo of Croton, and he was almost certainly the most successful wrestler of his day. Milo was a six-time wrestling champion at the Ancient Olympic Games in Greece. To become the greatest wrestler in Greece, Milo had to train like the rest of us, well perhaps not using exactly the same methods. However, his method did involve progressive overload. According to legend, Milo began his training by lifting a newborn calf on his shoulders and carrying it daily. As the calf grew, so did Milo’s strength, and eventually he could lift and carry the now full grown ox upon his back.\n   SAID Principle Another important principle of resistance training is specificity.\nPrinciple of Specificity\n Indicates that the physiologic adaptations in response to resistance training are specific to the type of “stress” or overload, and the manner in which it is applied to the body In other words, the amount of carryover from a resistance training exercise to a specific physical task or measurement of performance depends on the specificity of the exercise The greater the similarity of biomechanical movement and muscle fiber recruitment patterns between an exercise and the daily task, sport activity, or assessment the greater the specificity and carryover Also referred to as the SAID Principle - Specific Adaptations to Imposed Demands There are many aspects of specificity that influence the physiologic and physical improvement arising from a resistance training exercise or program:  Muscle Group Specificity  Perhaps the most obvious is muscle group specificity To attain improvements in muscular endurance, strength, and/or power, specific muscle groups must be directly subjected to an overload stimulus An exercise targeting the biceps will do nothing to cause adaptation in the gastrocnemius In general, multi-joint exercises have a greater specificity and carryover to motor performance tasks than single-joint exercises  Muscle Action Specificity  Muscle action specificity indicates that gains in muscular fitness are in part specific to the type of muscle action used in training For example, isometric actions, isotonic, which includes both concentric and eccentric actions, or isokinetic  Joint Angle Specificity  Closely related is the concept of joint angle specificity indicating that strength gains are greatest at or near the joint angle at which the overload is applied This is most obvious with isometric actions For example, if performing an isometric contraction of the biceps at 90 degrees of elbow flexion, the strength gains attained will be greatest at or near this specific joint angle  Velocity Specificity  Velocity specificity is the concept that resistance training produces the greatest gains in strength and power at the velocity or speed at which the training is performed This suggests that athletes should at some point include higher velocity resistance training movements to mimic their sport For someone interested in obtaining general strength gains, an intermediate velocity of movement (i.e., tempo) is generally recommended  Energy System / Metabolic Specificity  Finally, resistance training can also elicit adaptations specific to the metabolic systems predominately used to supply energy to the muscle during the exercise This is known as energy system specificity or metabolic specificity During resistance training, the energy is predominantly supplied by the anaerobic energy systems including the phosphagen system and anaerobic glycolysis The intensity and duration of each set will influence anaerobic energy system contribution:  Heavy resistance lifted for a low number of repetitions per set is likely to rely on the phosphagen system Lighter resistance lifted for a higher number of repetitions will rely more so on anaerobic glycolysis   Rest period duration will also influence energy system demands such that shorter rest periods, as seen with circuit training, will also stimulate increased aerobic capacity  Size Principle According to the size principle of motor unit recruitment, the smaller motor units or muscle fibers, having a low threshold for activation, are recruited first when the demand for muscular force is presented.\n Low threshold motor units are composed of type I muscle fibers Then, progressively higher threshold motor units are recruited based on the increasing demands for force or power Higher threshold motor units are comprised of the larger type II muscle fibers Order of motor unit and muscle fiber recruitment is important from a practical perspective First, to recruit type II fibers to achieve a training effect in those fibers, the resistance training exercise must involve heavy loading and/or high power output demands In addition, the muscle fiber recruitment order and pattern is fixed (i.e., specificity) for many movements including resistance training Therefore, variation in exercise and recruitment order is necessary to optimize gains in overall muscular fitness And this leads us to the next principle of training…    Variation Principle  The planned, strategic, and meaningful changes to one or more acute training variables or elements of the program Although a consistent stimulus is necessary for adaption to occur, over time variation in the program is needed to achieve optimal gains Variety in exercise programming may be reflected in the:  choice of exercise type of equipment order of exercise intensity volume rest periods tempo    Periodization Principle  A systematic manipulation of these training variables to optimize gains, while minimizing overtraining and potential injury We will revisit periodization of training later in this section  Reversibility Principle  If the overload stimulus is absent for an extended period of time, the physiologic adaptations attained from training will be gradually lost Although a planned short-term reduction of the overload (either by decreasing the intensity and/or volume of training as seen in a periodized program) may result in immediate performance improvements, removing the physiologic or physical stress for an extended period of time is likely to cause a loss of the training adaptations or “detraining” The detraining effects of inactivity may be influenced by several factors such as individual characteristics, health status, injury, level of physical fitness, training experience, and lifestyle behaviors This is known as the principle of reversibility, reflected by the statement:   “If you don’t use it, you lose it.”\n    Acute Training Variables Acute Training Variables (also known as Acute Program Variables) refers to a group of variables that can be manipulated and used to describe a resistance training exercise, session, or program.\nThese variables include, but are not limited to:\n choice of exercises order of exercises number of sets number of repetitions per set intensity or workload rest between sets rest between exercises tempo or repetition speed  Choice of Exercise  The choice of exercise relates to the targeted muscle(s), biomechanical characteristics, neuromuscular stimulus, and desired adaptation For example, exercises may be selected based on type of equipment (e.g., free weight versus machine), targeted body part, primary or secondary muscles, structural whole body movements, type of muscle action, or multi- or single-joint exercises  Order of Exercise  The order of exercises is an important element of workout and program design It has been suggested that exercising the large muscle groups first provides a superior training stimulus for all of the muscles involved Classically, multi-joint exercises are performed at the beginning of the workout followed by single joint exercises later in the routine The rationale, similar to large to small muscle group recommendations, is that multi-joint exercises require the greatest amount of muscle mass and energy for optimal performance Likewise, complex or high skill exercises should precede simple or low skill exercises, respectively Many popular resistance training systems, largely focused on exercise order, will be discussed later  Repetition   A repetition is one complete motion of an exercise, typically consisting of two phases:\n the concentric muscle action the eccentric muscle action    A repetition maximum, or RM, is the maximal number of repetitions that can be performed in one set with proper lifting technique\n  For example, with a given amount of resistance, if a participant could successfully complete 10 repetitions, but was unable to complete the 11th, then he or she would have completed a 10-repetition maximum set\n  The 1-RM typically represents an individual’s maximal muscular strength for a given exercise\n  Intensity  The intensity of a resistance training exercise is estimated as a percentage (%) of the one-repetition maximum (1-RM) or a specific repetition maximum (RM) resistance for an exercise For healthy, untrained individuals a minimum intensity of 60% 1-RM is typically necessary to elicit increased muscular strength; whereas, ≥ 80% of 1-RM results in maximal strength gains for weight-trained individuals It is often more practical to establish and monitor intensity of resistance training using a repetition maximum target zone:  Repetition maximum target zone  corresponds to the resistance necessary to elicit volitional muscle fatigue or momentary muscular failure within the desired repetition range For example, using a repetition maximum target zone of 8- to 10-RM, the participant will experience volitional muscle fatigue by the 8th repetition and momentary muscular failure at the 10th repetition A repetition training zone is a target range of typically three repetitions (e.g., 8-10, 10-12) corresponding to a resistance that allows the person to complete the desired number of repetitions with relative ease or resulting in volitional muscle fatigue      Resistance Training Continuum  In accordance with the principle of specificity, the intensity of the resistance training will influence the training adaptation:  Maximal muscular strength is developed using high intensity resistance training corresponding to 3- to 5-RM training zones Lighter loads such as 12-RM or lighter, have smaller effects on strength development, but are very effective for increasing local muscular endurance   The strength gains achieved above 25 repetitions per set are typically small to nonexistent    Tempo  Tempo (or cadence) refers to the speed at which each repetition is performed Repetition speed is dependent on training resistance, fatigue, and training goals, and has been shown to significantly affect neuromuscular and metabolic adaptations to resistance training As demonstrated by the force-velocity curve, force production and repetition speed have a direct inverse relationship such that concentric force production is higher at lower speeds and lower at higher speeds For general gains in muscular fitness, self-determined repetition speeds that are slow, controlled and deliberate should be used However, for power development and sport-specific training adaptations, higher velocities using lower resistance is necessary  Set  A set is a group of repetitions performed consecutively without stopping or rest A set can range from 1 to 20 or more repetitions Although a single set per exercise group may provide an adequate training stimulus during the initial stages of a resistance training program, 2-4 sets per muscle group are recommended for most adults to improve strength and power The duration of rest periods between sets and exercises is an important acute training variable that influences strength development:  A short rest period significantly increases the metabolic, hormonal, and cardiovascular responses to resistance training However, short rest periods may also compromise the development of maximal strength and power since fatigue will inhibit force production and activation of higher threshold motor units    Frequency  Frequency refers to the number of times certain resistance training exercises or muscle groups are trained per week Many factors influence the optimal frequency for resistance training such as:  volume intensity training status nutrition recovery ability training goals   A frequency of 2 to 3 days per week for each muscle group has been shown to elicit maximal strength gains in untrained individuals Appropriate rest periods between resistance training sessions is necessary for optimal adaptation and avoidance of overtraining Therefore, ≥ 48 hours of recovery is recommended between sessions for any given muscle group The rationale will be explained further in the next section  Super Compensation Cycle The acute response to the training stimulus of resistance training is a functional decrease in strength below the baseline level due to breakdown of muscle tissue.\n   During the recovery period, typically lasting 36-72 hours after training session, the body adapts and repairs the muscles, “super compensating” to a level slightly above the initial baseline. The next training stimulus again causes a temporary decrease in functional capacity followed by another period of repair, recovery, and adaptation “super-compensating” once again above the newly established baseline. Inadequate rest may contribute to over-training since the muscles are not allowed sufficient time to repair and adapt. This results in a downward trending baseline or at best a plateau in strength and functional capacity. If too much time elapses before the subsequent training stimulus (i.e., workout), then the super-compensation will fade, leading to involution, or a reduction in the individuals performance capacity. In other words, the super-compensation gained from the previous training session will be lost. Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome states:    If a stress or bout of exercise is experienced by a system, the system will respond with a temporary decrease in performance followed by restitution returning to or above the initial level of physical fitness.\n   This enhancement of physical fitness is termed supercompensation and is the primary purpose of all training interventions where an improvement in physical fitness is sought. If the applied stress remains at the same magnitude (intensity, volume and frequency) the system will accommodate to this stress and no further improvements in physical fitness will occur. To avoid this accommodation, training programs must be varied over time.  Resistance Training Guidelines The guidelines for resistance training presented, summarizes the key recommendations from the ACSM:\nSelect a minimum of 8 to 10 exercises targeting the major muscle groups\nMulti-joint exercises affecting more than one muscle group and targeting both agonist and antagonist muscle groups are recommended\n Single joint exercises may also be included, typically after performing multi-joint exercises for a particular muscle group  Most adults should train each muscle group for a total of 2 to 4 sets with 8 to 12 repetitions to improve strength and power\n Older adults and very deconditioned individuals should perform 1 or more sets of 10-15 repetitions Initially, a single set can be effective for increasing strength in older adults and novice exercisers; however, continued strength gains are attained more effectively when performing multiple sets  Resistance training for each major muscle group should be performed 2 to 3 days per week on nonconsecutive days separated by at least 48 hours for any single muscle group\n Rest periods of 2 to 3 minutes between sets/exercises are effective, but may vary based on training objective, health/fitness status, and intensity of resistance training  Adhere as closely as possible to the specific technique and postural alignment for each exercise\nPerform a full (pain-free) range of motion for all exercises\n Adhere to safe range of motion observing biomechanical and anatomic limitations  Perform both the concentric and eccentric phases of each exercise in a slow, deliberate, and controlled manner\nMaintain normal breathing pattern throughout the exercise\n Do not hold your breath or perform the Valsalva maneuver Exhale during the concentric and inhale during the eccentric phase  A gradual progression of greater resistance, and/or more repetitions per set, and/or increasing frequency is recommended\n The specific method of progression may be related to the desired outcome (e.g., strength, power, endurance, hypertrophy), as well as the health/fitness status and training history of the participant  Training Methods and Periodization Training Methods Circuit Training The order of exercise is among the acute training variables that may be altered within a resistance training session. The order of exercises will influence the training stimulus and also provide variety to maintain the interest and motivation of the exerciser.\n  A time-efficient strategy that is used to elicit strength, endurance, and metabolic adaptations is circuit training.\n  Generally speaking, circuit training consists of a series of resistance exercises performed in succession at a low- to moderate-intensity with minimal rest between sets.\n  Circuit resistance training is often designed as a total body workout using an upper to lower body alternating exercise order.\n  A sample total body circuit training routine is provided:\n Following a 10-minute cardiorespiratory warm-up, the circuit begins with the leg press, moving as indicted to each subsequent exercise. The participant complete 1 set of each exercise performing 12-15 repetitions to near muscle fatigue. Approximately 15-20 seconds of rest is allowed between sets. Completing just a single set of each exercise, this workout may be referred to as an “Express Circuit”. This circuit may also be repeated in the same exercise order for a second or third set of each exercise, or the participant may utilize a traditional set-rest-set to complete two sets of each exercise before moving to the next exercise.      The circuit may also be designed to alternate resistance training exercises with aerobic exercise stations:\n The participant begins by completing an adequate 10-minute aerobic warm-up. This sample circuit training routine begins with the stability ball squat performed for 45 seconds or until volitional muscle fatigue. The participant then proceeds to the next station of 12 inch stepping for 45 seconds. Continue progressing through each station. If conducting with a single participant, then the resistance exercise stations may be completed to an established repetition range. If conducting with a small group of participants, then timed stations are ideal to keep all participants moving from station to station in unison. In the case of small group training, each participant will need to begin their circuit at a different resistance exercise station.      Super Sets Another common strategy within a resistance training session is super sets. Super-set training involves alternating between two exercises, typically targeting opposing muscle groups or movements with minimal rest between sets:\n  Traditional Super-Set\n Includes alternate sets of two exercises for agonist and antagonist muscle groups For example, the leg extension machine and the prone leg curl machine, or a dumbbell biceps curl and a cable triceps pushdown are both super-sets involving single joint agonist paired with its single joint antagonist muscle group The seated row and a dumbbell chest press, or a lat pulldown and a dumbbell shoulder press are both super-sets involving a multi-joint pull exercise paired with a multi-joint push exercise The bench press may be performed with an arm curl machine, creating a multi-joint push and single joint pull super-set Similarly, a stability ball squat may be super-setted with a stability ball leg curl, or a dumbbell shoulder press with a dumbbell biceps curl Finally, a lat pulldown and a cable triceps pushdown is an example of a multi-joint pull - single joint push super set    Stacking (or Compound Sets)\n Another type of super-set involves alternate sets of two exercises for the same muscle group or body part For example, a push-up and a cable chest fly, a seated row and a reverse fly, or a body weight dip and a triceps pushdown    One advantage of super-set training is time efficiency when compared to traditional set-rest-set-rest training.\n  Pyramids Pyramid training is a strategy often used by power lifters to develop strength and power specific to the bench press, dead lift, and squat. However, the pyramid concept may be applied to other exercises and used by other populations as well:\n  Light-to-Heavy Ascending Half Pyramid\n may consist of 6 sets, beginning with a 10-repetition maximum set, followed by 8-RM, 6-RM, 4-RM, 2-RM, and concluding with a 1-RM lift    Heavy-to-Light Descending Half Pyramid\n progresses from a 1-RM lift to lighter sets ending with a 10-RM set      Full Pyramid\n consists of both the ascending and descending portions of the triangle      Periodization of Training Periodization of training refers to the planned and systematic changes in the acute program variables.\n Primary goals of periodization:  maximize the training effect to promote optimal fitness and performance manage fatigue to prevent training plateaus and overtraining    Periodized training programs are broken down into three primary components:\n Macrocycle (the annual training program)  represents the entire training period, often ranging from 6 months to 1 year or longer comprised of several mesocycles   Mesocycles (a phase of the macrocycle or monthly plan)  represents a smaller training period, each of which may last from several weeks to months and is focused on a specific training goal such as endurance, strength, or power made up of smaller microcycles   Microcycles (the weekly training plan)  typically represents 1 week blocks of training or even individual workout sessions    Generally speaking, two types of periodization are commonly utilized:\n Linear Periodization (also called Classic Periodization)  progressively increases training intensity as the corresponding training volume decreases   Nonlinear Periodization (also called Undulating Periodization)  more frequent changes in training intensity and volume, often from one workout session to the next    Linear Periodization The table provided outlines the phases or cycle of a linear periodization model:\n   The first row indicates the phases of a linear model using the typical European terminology The second row indicates the phases using traditional American terminology The third row indicates the phases using the American strength/power model terminology The bottom of the table provides the general parameters for the acute training variables as they correspond to the American strength/power linear periodization model  Keep in mind that many variations of these linear models have been developed for various sports and individual athletes. This table simply provides a schematic overview of common underlying models that guide most linear periodization training programs.\nA key characteristic of linear periodization is an initial high volume and low intensity with gradual increases in intensity and decreases in volume within and across training periods.\n Linear periodization is often effectively applied to sport-specific training programs for athletes. A potential limitation to a well-designed linear program for health-seekers and fitness enthusiasts is inconsistency of training, which disrupts the linear progression and continuity of the program.  Nonlinear Periodization This table outlines possible nonlinear periodization models:\n  The intensity of each week or training session is typically defined by the repetition-maximum (RM) target range applied to most exercise sets within the respective phase.\n For example:  12-15 RM sets may be conceptualized as a “low” intensity or “light” resistance 8-10 RM may be considered a “moderate” intensity or resistance 4-6 RM a “high” intensity or “heavy” resistance    Similar to linear periodization, as the intensity increases, the volume decreases.\n So, the volume of training is high during a low-intensity week or day, on the other hand the volume of training is low on a high-intensity week or day. Rest periods between sets and exercises also correspond to intensity:  low-intensity resistance training will require shorter rest periods (e.g., 20-60 seconds) high-intensity resistance training will require longer rest periods (e.g., 2-3 minutes)    The convenience, flexibility, and variety offered by nonlinear periodization has contributed to its gain in popularity among participants seeking fitness-oriented goals.\nBoth linear and nonlinear periodization strategies may also be implemented following contemporary approaches focused on stabilization-, strength-, and power-oriented training, which is summarized next.\nResistance Training Progressions The ability to stabilize the kinetic chain, both statically and dynamically, is the foundation for efficient movement.\n  Stabilization Therefore, the initial stage of a resistance training program for a novice client should focus on stabilization-oriented exercises.\n This stage of training utilizes exercises for the basic movement patterns utilizing the major muscle groups in a multi-joint fashion. The focus is on lower-intensity resistance training to develop foundational muscular endurance, motor learning of movement patterns, and kinesthetic awareness. Stabilization-oriented resistance training exercises challenge one’s ability to maintain joint alignment and posture while lifting and lowering an external resistance. Stabilization-oriented exercise are progressed by introducing greater instability to the exercise. Since the resistance is relatively light, stabilization-oriented exercises tend to involve higher-repetition sets, therefore exercises of this nature also contribute to increased muscular endurance. Stabilization-oriented core exercises are those that do not involve movement of the spine:  For example, planks, bridges, bird-dogs These exercises are progressed by increasing instability, movement of the arms and/or legs, and/or increasing the exercise repetition time under tension (i.e., duration of the exercise)    Muscular Strength The next stage of training focuses on muscular strength development.\n Strength-oriented exercises are more stable allowing for the use of relatively heavier weights, lifted for a lower number of repetitions per set. Generally speaking, these exercises tend to be more traditional, such as free weights and machines. Strength-oriented exercises are progressed by increasing the intensity or the workload (i.e., amount of weight lifted). As training volume increases, strength-oriented resistance training also promote muscle hypertrophy.  Power Eventually, and when appropriate for the client, training may progress to include power-oriented exercises.\nMuscular power training shifts the training methods to enhance rate of force development (i.e., speed and explosiveness) utilizing a relatively low % of 1-RM.\n This type of training enhances neuromuscular adaptations and increases sports performance. Exercises may be plyometric in nature an utilize tools such as medicine balls. Although power may be increased by increasing the external workload, power-oriented exercises are often progressed by increasing the rate of force production, in other words, the speed of movement.  Pillars of Resistance Training Program Design Resistance training programs may be built around four basic pillars, generally corresponding to movement patterns, including:\n Lower body exercises Upper body pushing exercises typically involving the chest, shoulders and/or triceps Upper body pulling exercises typically involving the upper back and/or biceps Core or rotational exercises    Exercises that incorporate two or more movement patterns, are multi-planar in nature, and involve acceleration, deceleration and stabilization, are representative of “functional” exercises.\nKeeping these major exercise categories in mind can help guide basic resistance training program design.\nProgramming Design Needs Analysis The personal trainer’s resistance training ‘toolbox' contains countless exercises, programming methodologies and a seemingly infinite number of progressions or modifications. For the novice personal trainer it may be overwhelming trying to decide which exercises and training strategies will be most effective for a client.\nBefore designing a resistance training program or workout, what does the personal trainer need to know about their client?\n  Health \u0026 Fitness Goals?\n What are the client’s health and fitness goals?    Health Status?\n What is the client’s current health status? Does the client have any known illness, disease, or other medical considerations?    Orthopedic Issues?\n Does the client have any orthopedic issues or limitations?    Level of Fitness?\n What is the client’s currently level of fitness?    Exercise \u0026 Activity History?\n What is the client’s exercise and activity history? Does he or she have past experience with resistance training?    Exercise Preferences?\n What are the client’s preferences - likes and dislikes with regard to specific exercises?    Sport-Specific Needs?\n Does the client have sport- or occupational-specific needs?    What Else?\n What else might you need to consider when designing a resistance training program?    Using the knowledge gained from this section combined with insights about a client obtaining during the initial intake, preparticipation screening, and fitness assessment, the personal trainer may begin to construct resistance training programs that are both safe and effective for their clients.\n Section 4: Flexibility Training Section four will review:\n potential benefits of flexibility training types of stretching exercises guidelines for flexibility training to increase range of motion  Benefits of Flexibility Training An appropriate level of flexibility is necessary for health, fitness, and in some cases performance.\n Proper postural alignment and neuromuscular efficiency are dependent upon a normal length-tension relationship among muscle groups. Many activities of daily living, such as getting in and out of a car, necessitate an adequate level of joint range of motion. In addition, certain sports and activities, such as dance, gymnastics, wrestling, and diving, require a high degree of flexibility for optimal performance.  The proposed benefits of flexibility training include:\n Restoration and/or maintenance of muscle balance necessary for proper postural alignment Decreased muscular tension and musculotendinous stiffness Reduced joint stress May reduce the risk of musculoskeletal injury Reduced incidence of low back pain Facilitation of physical and mental relaxation Increased performance in sports and activities, which require a high degree of flexibility  Although most of the proposed benefits of stretching are generally accepted, in recent years some research has challenged these long-held beliefs.\n In particular, several studies have suggested that static stretching performed before or after exercise does not reduce the risk of injury or the severity of delayed onset muscle soreness. In addition, many researchers have studied the impact of static stretching on athletic performance, especially with regard to maximal force production, sprint speed, and vertical jump height as a measure of power. The results of these studies suggest that pre-activity static stretching acutely decreases muscle strength, slows sprint speed, and reduces vertical jump height.  This is not to suggest that stretching exercise should be avoided.\n In fact, stretching to maintain or improve range of motion continues to be an important component of health-related physical fitness. However, the type and timing of flexibility exercises is an important consideration when designing an exercise program.  Sensory Receptors Before introducing the various types of flexibility training, it is necessary to briefly review the sensory receptors that mediate the physical and physiologic responses to stretching exercises.\nTwo important sensory receptors include:\n muscle spindles Golgi tendon organs  Muscle Spindles Muscle spindles are sensory receptors located within the skeletal muscle that are sensitive to changes in length and rate of length change.\nStretch Reflex:\n When stimulated by a sudden lengthening of the muscle, the muscle spindles will cause a reflexive contraction of the muscle in an effort to prevent injury that may result from over-stretching or stretching too rapidly. For example. this can be seen when a doctor uses a rubber mallet to tap the patellar tendon causing a reflexive contraction of the quadriceps.  Reciprocal Inhibition:\n The motor unit stimulation and subsequent contraction of a muscle is accompanied by simultaneous decrease in neural drive and deactivation of the opposite muscles, in this case the hamstrings, causing antagonist muscle relaxation.  Golgi Tendon Organs (GTO) Golgi tendon organs (GTO) are sensory receptors located in the musculotendinous unit that are sensitive to changes in muscular tension and the rate of tension change.\n When stimulated by rapidly increasing or excessive tension, the Golgi tendon organs cause the muscle to relax, thus preventing excessive stress and potential injury.  Autogenic Inhibition:\n The neural response that causes the muscle’s own receptors to cause the relaxation Stimulation of the Golgi tendon organs inhibits activation of the muscle spindle fibers within the same muscle, which leads the relaxation of the muscle.  Types of Stretches and Flexibility Training A variety of flexibility exercises are used to increase joint range of motion including stretching techniques such as static, ballistic, dynamic, and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF).\nIn addition, self-myofascial release is also used to increase flexibility using tools such as a foam roller.\nStatic Static stretching is perhaps the most common mode of flexibility training used by fitness professionals and is generally regarded as a safe and effective method to increase range of motion.\n Static stretching involves moving a muscle into a lengthened position causing mild discomfort, but not pain, which is held for an extended period of time, typically 10-30 seconds. Static stretches may be performed either:  actively or passively    Active During an active stretch the targeted muscle is lengthened using internal force generated by activation of the antagonist muscles.\n For example, the hamstrings may be lengthened to elicit an active stretch by positioning the hip at approximately 90 degrees of flexion and then actively contracting the quadriceps to gently extend the knee. The contraction of the agonist muscle causes efferent nerve impulses to inhibit antagonist muscle activation leading to relaxation of the antagonist muscle group via reciprocal inhibition.  Passive A passive stretch relies upon an external force provided by an unrelated body part, a personal trainer, or a device (e.g., stretching strap, wall, ballet barre), to position a body segment such that a stretch is applied to the targeted muscle.\n For example, with the client lying supine on a mat or stretching table, the personal trainer lifts the client’s leg with the knee extended, moving the hip into flexion until a stretch is felt through the hamstrings. The passive lengthening of the hamstring muscles creates tension, which stimulates the GTOs and leads to relaxation of the hamstrings via autogenic inhibition.  Dynamic Dynamic stretching exercises utilize slow, controlled, and rhythmic movements to actively increase joint range of motion.\n Dynamic stretches are typically performed during the pre-activity warm-up to replicate certain sport-specific and functional movements. These activities utilize:  body weight or light resistance, such as a medicine ball or resistance tubing, and involve calisthenic type movements such as body weight squats, walking and lateral lunges, and medicine ball chops and lifts   Dynamic range of motion activities may also involve single-joint movements such as shoulder circles or leg swings. The dynamic nature of these activities also function to increase tissue temperature, elasticity, and extensibility, which are likely to contribute to increased range of motion and decreased risk of injury during exercise.  Ballistic Ballistic stretching techniques utilize rapid bouncing movements in an effort to lengthen and stretch the targeted muscle.\n Ballistic stretching may be counter-productive to improvements in joint range of motion since the ballistic movements may initiate the stretch reflex causing the effected muscle to contract, restricting range of motion. In addition, if ballistic stretches are performed too aggressively or are not preceded by a proper warm-up, they may cause unnecessary muscle soreness and potentially lead to musculotendinous injury. For these reasons, ballistic stretching is typically not recommended for improving range of motion among those seeking improved health and fitness. However, ballistic stretching may confer some improvements in range of motion and performance among athletes, particularly those participating in sports or activities that involve ballistic-type movements.  Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) includes several variations of stretching techniques that couple passive static stretching and muscle activation.\n An example of a PNF stretching technique is the “contract relax” method, which typically refers to a passive stretch of the targeted muscle, followed by an isometric contraction of the targeted muscle, which is then followed by another passive stretch of the same muscle.  Self-Myofascial Release (SMR) Self-myofascial release (SMR) is a technique during which an individual uses their own body weight to apply pressure to a targeted muscle using a foam roller or similar device.\n Some of the common SMR exercises using a foam roller target the quadriceps, gluteals, iliotibial band, and calves.  Guidelines for Flexibility Training The following guidelines should be observed for flexibility training, in particular when performing static stretching:\n Flexibility training is more effective when preceded by an adequate warm-up A series of flexibility exercises should be performed targeting each of the major muscle groups Flexibility exercises should be performed at least 2-3 days per week with daily being most effective Stretch to the point of tightness or mild discomfort, but not pain Holding a static stretch for 10-30 seconds is recommended for most adults It is recommended that each flexibility exercise is performed 2 to 4 times per session, with a target of 60 seconds total time for each flexibility exercise  ",

<p>Section one of this module provides an introduction to physical activity and principles of exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li>the well-documented benefits of regular physical activity</li>
<li>the physical activity recommendations for improved health</li>
<li>components of health-related physical fitness</li>
<li>principles of exercise training</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-terms">Key Terms<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-terms">#</a></h2>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, health does not merely represent the absence of disease, but also reflects a state of optimal physical, social, and psychological well-being.</p>
<ul>
<li>Health is impacted by many interrelated factors such as the environment, genetics, socioeconomic status, and modifiable lifestyle behaviors such as nutrition and physical activity.</li>
<li>The state of one&rsquo;s health falls somewhere on a continuum with positive and negative poles:
<ul>
<li>Positive health is associated with the capacity to enjoy life, withstand challenges, and avoid illness and disease.</li>
<li>Negative health is associated with illness, chronic disease, and premature death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Physical activity has been defined as any bodily movement produced by the use of skeletal muscles that increases energy expenditure above the resting level.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Physical activity is comprised of 4 major domains:
<ul>
<li><strong>domestic physical activity</strong>
<ul>
<li>yard work, household chores, and child care</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>transportation physical activity</strong>
<ul>
<li>walking or biking</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>occupational physical activity</strong>
<ul>
<li>all work-related activities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>leisure-time physical activity</strong>
<ul>
<li>recreation, sports, and exercise</li>
<li><em><strong>exercise</strong> is defined as planned, structured, and repetitive bodily movement performed to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness</em>, such as cardiorespiratory or aerobic exercise, resistance training exercise, and flexibility exercises such as stretching</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Physical fitness</strong> is <em>a set of attributes possessed or attained by an individual that contribute to the ability to perform physical activity with vigor and without undue fatigue</em>.</p>
<p>The health-related components of physical fitness include:</p>
<ul>
<li>cardiorespiratory endurance</li>
<li>body composition</li>
<li>muscular strength</li>
<li>muscular endurance</li>
<li>flexibility</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="health-benefits-of-physical-activity">Health Benefits of Physical Activity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#health-benefits-of-physical-activity">#</a></h2>
<p>Countless scientific and epidemiologic research studies provide an overwhelming body of evidence regarding the many health benefits associated with regular physical activity. Although physical activity and exercise do present some risks, for the vast majority of individuals, the long-term health benefits of a physically active lifestyle far outweigh the potential acute risks.</p>
<p>For adults, there is strong scientific evidence to support the health benefits of physical activity including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces the risk of all-cause premature death</li>
<li>Reduces the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke</li>
<li>Reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>Reduces the risk of high blood pressure (i.e., hypertension)</li>
<li>Lowers blood pressure in people who already have hypertension</li>
<li>Reduces the risk of developing colon cancer and breast cancer</li>
<li>Reduces feelings of depression and anxiety</li>
<li>Helps to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight</li>
<li>Helps build and maintain healthy bones, muscles, and joints</li>
<li>Improves cardiorespiratory endurance</li>
<li>Promotes psychological well-being and improved cognitive function</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits of regular physical activity are indisputable. As stated by Booth and colleagues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Indeed, with the possible exception of diet modifications, we know of no single intervention with greater promise than physical exercise to reduce the risk of virtually all chronic diseases, simultaneously.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="public-health-physical-activity-recommendations">Public Health Physical Activity Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#public-health-physical-activity-recommendations">#</a></h2>
<p>The health benefits of physical activity have been promoted for several decades. Among the first population-based physical activity recommendations were those jointly published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine in 1995. This consensus statement recommended:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every US adult should accumulate 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days of the week.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly thereafter, a very similar recommendation was stated in <em>Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon General</em>. This recommendation indicated:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Significant health benefits can be obtained by including a moderate amount of physical activity on most, if not all, days of the week. Through a modest increase in daily activity, most Americans can improve their health and quality of life.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2007, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Heart Association (AHA) updated the physical activity recommendations for adults. The primary recommendation of this report states:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“To promote and maintain health, all healthy adults aged 18 to 65 years need moderate-intensity aerobic (endurance) physical activity for a minimum of 30 minutes on five days each week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 minutes on three days each week. Combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet this recommendation.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="2008-physical-activity-guidelines-for-americans">2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2008-physical-activity-guidelines-for-americans">#</a></h2>
<p>In recognition of the strong scientific evidence demonstrating a positive association between physical activity and health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.*</p>
<p>The content of the Physical Activity Guidelines is intended to complement the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (see chapter 9). Together these two publications provide direction to policymakers and health professionals regarding the promotion of physical activity and healthy dietary practices. The PAGA include guidelines for adults as well as other groups within the population including children and adolescents, older adults, women during pregnancy and the postpartum period, adults with disabilities, and people with chronic medical conditions.</p>
<p><em><strong>The key physical activity guidelines are as follows:</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>All adults should avoid inactivity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some physical activity is better than none, and adults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity</strong> or</li>
<li><strong>75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity</strong> or</li>
<li><strong>an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous- intensity aerobic activity</strong></li>
<li>Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes, and preferably, it should be spread throughout the entire week</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For additional and more extensive health benefits, adults should increase their aerobic physical activity to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity</strong> or</li>
<li><strong>150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity</strong> or</li>
<li><strong>an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity</strong></li>
<li>Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond this amount</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adults should also do <strong>muscle-strengthening activities that are moderate- or high-intensity and involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week</strong>, as these activities provide additional health benefits</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines is scheduled to be released in late 2018. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee is responsible for reviewing the body of scientific and medical evidence in physical activity and health. Using this evidence, the Advisory Committee will prepare a scientific report that documents the background and rationale for its recommendations for the second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. <em>For more information regarding the development of the forthcoming 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines, please visit the health.gov website.</em></p>
<h2 id="relative-and-absolute-physical-activity-intensity">Relative and Absolute Physical Activity Intensity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#relative-and-absolute-physical-activity-intensity">#</a></h2>
<p>The recommendations and guidelines for physical activity utilize terms such as moderate- and vigorous-intensity.</p>
<p>The two primary approaches to define and monitor the intensity of physical activity include <em>relative intensity</em> and <em>absolute intensity</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Relative Intensity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>based on the level of individual effort required to perform a certain activity</li>
<li>synonymous to <strong>Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE)</strong>, which will be discussed further in the next section of this module</li>
<li>generally speaking, less fit individuals require a subjectively higher level of effort than well-conditioned individuals to perform the same activity</li>
<li>the relative intensity or effort <strong>can be estimated using a scale from 0 to 10</strong>
<ul>
<li>sitting quietly resting is 0 and the maximal possible effort is 10</li>
<li><strong>moderate-intensity is equivalent to a rating of 5 or 6</strong></li>
<li><strong>vigorous-intensity is equivalent to a rating of 7 or 8</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Absolute Intensity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Physical Activity Guidelines have been established based on absolute intensity since scientific research largely demonstrates that the health benefits of physical activity are dependent upon the total weekly amount of energy expended</li>
<li>measured by <strong>Metabolic Equivalent (MET)</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>the unit of measurement used to define the absolute energy expenditure of a specific activity</em></li>
<li>1 MET is the rate of energy expenditure during an activity (i.e., activity metabolic rate) divided by the rate of energy expenditure at rest (i.e., resting metabolic rate)</li>
<li><strong>1 MET is equal to an oxygen consumption of approximately 3.5 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute</strong></li>
<li><strong>moderate-intensity</strong> physical activity corresponds to a MET value of <strong>3.0 to 5.9</strong></li>
<li><strong>vigorous intensity</strong> physical activity corresponds to a MET value <strong>greater than or equal to 6.0</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="understanding-mets">Understanding METs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#understanding-mets">#</a></h2>
<p>Metabolic Equivalent (MET) is an estimate of intensity based on the ratio of exercise metabolic rate to resting metabolic rate</p>
<ul>
<li>1 MET is equivalent to an oxygen uptake of 3.5 mL/kg/min and represents the resting oxygen consumption
<ul>
<li><em><strong>VO2rest = 3.5 mL/kg/min = 1 MET (metabolic equivalent)</strong></em></li>
<li>Physical activity performed at 2 METs requires twice the resting oxygen consumption, 3 METs equals three times rest, and so on…</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities/">Compendium of Physical Activities</a> has been established as a resource to estimate and classify the energy costs of various physical activities. The Compendium includes a comprehensive list of physical activities and their respective MET values for 21 major categories of activities.</p>
<p><em><strong>Calculating relative oxygen consumption:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Using the MET value for a particular physical activity, the relative oxygen consumption may be calculated:
<ul>
<li>For example, according to the Compendium of Physical Activities, walking at 3 miles per hour and 1% grade is equivalent to an intensity of 5.3 METs:
<ul>
<li>5.3 METs x 3.5 mL/kg/min = 18.6 mL/kg/min</li>
<li>therefore the relative oxygen consumption necessary to perform this activity is 18.6 mL/kg/min</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Converting relative oxygen consumption into METs:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Likewise, if an individual&rsquo;s relative oxygen consumption is measured or calculated during a specific activity, then the intensity of this activity may be converted to METs:
<ul>
<li>For example, a client&rsquo;s oxygen consumption while running on a treadmill is measured as 36.8 mL/kg/min:
<ul>
<li>36.8 mL/kg/min ÷ 5.3 METs = 10.5 METs</li>
<li>this is equivalent to approximately 10.5 METs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sample-calculations">Sample Calculations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sample-calculations">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A participant is walking briskly on a treadmill at 4.2 mph with 3% grade. The display panel indicates the participant is exercising at 7.2 METs. What is the estimated relative oxygen consumption for this participant?</p>
<ul>
<li>7.2 METs x 3.5 mL/kg/min = 25.2 mL/kg/min</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the appropriate classification of physical activity performed at 7.2 METs?</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the classification system presented previously, physical activity greater or equal to 6 METs is vigorous, therefore physical activity performed at 7.2 is classified as vigorous-intensity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the Rockport One Mile Walk Test, a client&rsquo;s maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) is estimated to be 34.2 mL/kg/min. What is this client&rsquo;s estimated maximal MET capacity?</p>
<ul>
<li>34.2 mL/kg/min ÷ 3.5 mL/kg/min = 9.8 METs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="health-related-components-of-physical-fitness">Health-Related Components of Physical Fitness<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#health-related-components-of-physical-fitness">#</a></h2>
<p>The five components of health-related physical fitness include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cardiorespiratory Endurance</strong>
<ul>
<li>the capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to the working muscles during continuous aerobic physical activity, expressed as maximal oxygen consumption or VO2max</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Body Composition</strong>
<ul>
<li>the relative amount of fat mass and lean body mass throughout the body, and is expressed as a percent body fat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Muscular Strength</strong>
<ul>
<li>the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to exert a maximum force against an external load, often expressed in terms of one-repetition maximum weight lifted for a specific exercise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Muscular Endurance</strong>
<ul>
<li>the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to repeatedly exert submaximal force against a resistance over a period of time, typically quantified as the maximal number of repetitions performed during a specific exercise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>
<ul>
<li>the ability to move through a full, pain-free range of motion, often measured in degrees or distance moved in a particular direction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="principles-of-exercise-training">Principles of Exercise Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#principles-of-exercise-training">#</a></h2>
<p>Inherent to any exercise program is the objective to improve health as well as develop one or more components of physical fitness.</p>
<p><em>The stimulus provided by an exercise program causes a <strong>training effect</strong>, which refers to the physiological and physical adaptations resulting from exercise.</em></p>
<p>There are several underlying principles of training which are characteristic of any exercise program and are influential upon the training effect, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>overload</li>
<li>progression</li>
<li>specificity</li>
<li>variation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overload">Overload<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#overload">#</a></h3>
<p><em>Principle of Overload refers to the application of a physiologic or physical stress greater than that to which the body, system, or targeted tissue is normally subjected.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This greater-than-normal stress may be applied through any number of variables including an increase in exercise intensity, duration, or volume, as well as choice of exercise or manipulation of rest periods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="progression">Progression<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#progression">#</a></h3>
<p><em>Principle of Progression indicates that as the system and/or tissue adapts and becomes accustomed to the current stress, the training stimulus must be increased in order to apply sufficient overload for additional adaptation and improvement.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>To minimize the risk of injury, the magnitude of the progression must be gradual and appropriate to the health status, level of fitness, and capabilities of the participant.</li>

<h3 id="specificity">Specificity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#specificity">#</a></h3>
<p><em>Principle of Specificity indicates that the physiologic and physical adaptations in response to the overload are specific to the type of &ldquo;stress&rdquo; and the manner in which it is applied to the body.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>In other words, the training effect is specific to the training stimulus.</li>
<li>The principle of specificity is also referred to as the <strong>S.A.I.D. Principle:</strong>

<h3 id="variation">Variation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#variation">#</a></h3>
<p><em>Principle of Variation is described by the planned, strategic, and meaningful changes or variety within an exercise program.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Variety may be created by the choice of exercise modality or through alterations of other acute training variables such as intensity, duration, or volume of exercise.</li>
<li>In addition, variety is also important to maintain participant interest, motivation, and adherence to an exercise program.</li>

<h1 id="section-2-cardiorespiratory-programming">Section 2: Cardiorespiratory Programming<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-2-cardiorespiratory-programming">#</a></h1>
<p><strong>Cardiorespiratory Endurance</strong> is defined as <em>the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to the muscles during sustained physical activity or exercise.</em></p>
<p>The training stimulus necessary to increase cardiorespiratory endurance is provided by exercise that is primarily aerobic in nature and involves the use of large muscle groups in a rhythmic and continuous manner.</p>
<p>Section two will present guidelines and programming considerations with regard to cardiorespiratory exercise (CRE) training.</p>
<h2 id="elements-of-a-cre-workout">Elements of a CRE Workout<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#elements-of-a-cre-workout">#</a></h2>
<p>An individual session of cardiorespiratory exercise includes three elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>warm-up</li>
<li>conditioning</li>
<li>a cool-down</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="warm-up">Warm-Up<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#warm-up">#</a></h3>
<p><em>The warm-up serves to prepare the body physically, physiologically, and psychologically for the relatively higher intensity exercise that will be performed during the conditioning phase of the session.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A typical warm-up consists of <strong>at least 5 to 10 minutes of light- to moderate-intensity</strong> aerobic activity gradually progressing to the intensity to be sustained during the conditioning phase.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conditioning">Conditioning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conditioning">#</a></h3>
<p><em>The conditioning phase of the session provides the primary training stimulus to increase cardiorespiratory endurance.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The conditioning phase typically represents <strong>20 to 60 minutes</strong> of the session during which aerobic-type exercise is performed.</li>
<li>This may include exercises such as walking, jogging, running, cycling, elliptical training, stair climbing, rowing, and any other mode of exercise that is primarily aerobic in nature and involves the use of large muscle groups in a rhythmic and continuous manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cool-down">Cool-Down<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cool-down">#</a></h3>
<p><em>The cool-down follows the conditioning phase of the exercise session.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the warm-up, the cool-down consists of <strong>5 to 10 minutes of light- to moderate-intensity</strong> aerobic activity.</li>
<li>In addition, the cool-down is often concluded with flexibility exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The purpose of the cool-down is to allow for the gradual return of cardiorespiratory systems back toward pre-exercise levels, as seen by a decrease in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration, and to facilitate the removal of metabolic byproducts from the skeletal muscles.</em></p>
<h2 id="objectives-of-the-warm-up">Objectives of the Warm-up<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#objectives-of-the-warm-up">#</a></h2>
<p>The physiologic and psychologic objectives and benefits of the warm-up include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows for a gradual metabolic adaptation, such as increased oxygen uptake, which enhances cardiorespiratory performance.</li>
<li>Prevents premature onset of blood lactate accumulation and undue fatigue during higher-intensity exercise.</li>
<li>Reduces the oxygen deficit observed at the onset of exercise.</li>
<li>Causes a gradual increase in muscle temperature which decreases the work of contraction and reduces the likelihood of muscle injury.</li>
<li>Facilitates better neural transmission and motor unit recruitment.</li>
<li>Improves coronary blood flow and lessens the potential for myocardial ischemia.</li>
<li>Allows gradual redistribution of blood flow to the exercising muscle.</li>
<li>Increases the elasticity of the connective tissues and other muscle components.</li>
<li>Provides psychological preparation for higher levels of exercise, increases arousal, motivation, and focus.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objectives-of-the-cool-down">Objectives of the Cool-down<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#objectives-of-the-cool-down">#</a></h2>
<p>The objectives and benefits of the cool-down include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevents post-exercise venous blood pooling.</li>
<li>Reduces potential for sudden drop in blood pressure (hypotension), thereby reducing the likelihood of post-exercise lightheadedness and fainting.</li>
<li>Ensures continued adequate circulation to the skeletal muscles, heart, and brain.</li>
<li>Reduces immediate post-exercise tendency for muscle spasm and cramping.</li>
<li>Reduces the concentration of exercise hormones, such as norepinephrine, thereby lowering the probability of post-exercise disturbances in cardiac rhythm.</li>
<li>May mitigate the severity and duration of delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS).</li>

<li>For most adults to achieve and maintain health and fitness benefits, it is recommended;
<ul>
<li><strong>moderate-intensity</strong> exercise is performed at least <strong>5 days</strong> per week, or</li>
<li><strong>vigorous intensity</strong> exercise is performed at least <strong>3 days</strong> per week, or</li>

<li><strong>moderate- and/or vigorous-intensity exercise</strong></li>
<li><em>however, very deconditioned individuals may place initial focus on light- to moderate-intensity exercise</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Several methods exist to establish and monitor exercise intensity, such as heart rate and rating of perceived exertion</li>
<li>The specific parameters pertaining to the various method that may be used to monitor exercise intensity will be presented in the next section</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>continuously during one session</strong> or</li>
<li><strong>accumulated throughout the day in intermittent bouts each lasting a minimum of 10 minutes</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is recommended to accumulate:
<ul>
<li><strong>30 to 60 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>20 to 60 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise</strong>, or</li>
<li>an equivalent <strong>combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity</strong> exercise each day</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="type">Type<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#type">#</a></h3>
<p>Type, or mode of exercise, answers the question, <em>“What kind of exercise should I perform?”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Rhythmic, aerobic exercise that involves large muscle groups and requires little skill to perform is recommended for all adults to improve health and cardiorespiratory fitness</li>
<li>Certainly, a wide variety of options are available with regard to the type of cardiorespiratory exercise</li>

<p>The most common methods used to monitor exercise intensity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heart Rate Reserve percentage</li>
<li>Maximal Heart Rate percentage</li>
<li>Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) using the category-ratio scale from 0 to 10</li>
<li>Metabolic Equivalents (METs)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To improve overall health and cardiorespiratory fitness, it is recommended that most adults exercise at a moderate- and/or vigorous-intensity.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, most adults will exercise at an intensity corresponding to
<ul>
<li><strong>40 to 89% of heart rate reserve</strong></li>
<li><strong>64 to 95% of maximum heart rate</strong></li>
<li><strong>RPE from 5 to 8</strong></li>
<li><strong>MET level of 3.0 to 8.7</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Within these parameters, it is important advise clients to exercise at a specific intensity that is safe and appropriate to their personal goals, health status, level of fitness, physical limitations, and motivation as well as the objective for a particular bout of exercise.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="maximal-heart-rate-method-hrmax">Maximal Heart Rate Method (HRmax)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#maximal-heart-rate-method-hrmax">#</a></h4>
<p>Historically, one of the most common approaches to monitor exercise intensity in the fitness setting is the maximal heart rate (HRmax) method. This method utilizes maximal heart rate as the anchor point from which the <strong>target heart rate (THR)</strong> is calculated as a straight percentage of the HRmax.</p>
<p>Numerous formulas have been developed to estimate age-predicted maximum heart rate among various populations. Perhaps the most frequently used <em><strong>equation to estimate maximum heart rate is 220 minus age</strong></em>, which was proposed by Fox and colleagues in 1971. Given the simplicity and prevalent use of this  “220 - age” formula, we will utilize this prediction equation when presenting sample target heart rate calculations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>220 - age = HRmax</code></li>
<li><code>HRmax x Desired % = Target Heart Rate (THR)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, using the maximal heart rate method, what is the target heart rate for a 35-year-old client wishing to exercise at 75% of their maximum heart rate?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <em>Calculate the age-predicted maximum heart rate by subtracting the age of 35 years from 220, which equals an estimated maximum heart rate of 185 beats per minute:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>220 - age = HRmax</code></li>
<li><code>220 - 35 = 185 HRmax</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <em>Calculate the target heart rate by multiplying the maximum heart rate by the desired 75%, which equals a target heart rate of 139 beats per minute:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>HRmax x Desired % = Target Heart Rate (THR)</code></li>
<li><code>185 x 0.75 = 139 b/min THR</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="heart-rate-reserve-hrr">Heart Rate Reserve (HRR)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#heart-rate-reserve-hrr">#</a></h4>
<p>Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) method is another approach to determine the target heart rate.</p>
<p>This method was first introduced by the physiologist, Dr. M.J. Karvonen and has therefore come to be known as the <strong>Karvonen Formula</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <em>The calculation of target heart rate begins with the standard “220 - age” to estimate maximum heart rate:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>220 - age = HRmax</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <em>The next step is to calculate the heart rate reserve, which is the difference between the maximum heart rate and the resting heart rate, so HRmax minus resting heart rate equals heart rate reserve:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>HRmax - RHR = HRR</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <em>The heart rate reserve is multiplied by the desired training percentage, and then the resting heart rate is added back in to obtain the target heart rate:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>HRR x Desired % + RHR = Target Heart Rate (THR)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: What is the target heart rate for a 35-year-old client with a resting heart rate of 65 wishing to exercise at 70% of heart rate reserve?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Step One:</strong> <em>Determine the age-predicted maximum heart rate by subtracting the age of 35 from 220, which equals 185:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>220 - age = HRmax</code></li>
<li><code>220 - 35 = 185 HRmax</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step Two:</strong> - <em>Determine the heart rate reserve by subtracting the resting heart rate of 65 from the maximum heart rate of 185, which equals a heart rate reserve of 120:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>HRmax - RHR = HRR</code></li>
<li><code>185 - 65 = 120 HRR</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step Three:</strong> <em>Calculate the target heart rate by multiplying the heart rate reserve by the desired 70%, then add the resting heart rate back in to obtain the client&rsquo;s target heart rate, which in this case is 149 beats per minute:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>HRR x Desired % + RHR = Target Heart Rate (THR)</code></li>
<li><code>120 x 0.70 + 65 = 149 b/min THR</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="limitations-of-age-predicted-hrmax">Limitations of Age-Predicted HRmax<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#limitations-of-age-predicted-hrmax">#</a></h4>
<p>The simplicity of the 220-age prediction equation has likely contributed to its widespread use among fitness professionals despite the many research studies that have noted a significant margin of error among maximum heart rate values derived from this formula.</p>
<p><em><strong>It has been reported that the margin of error for this formula is plus or minus 10 beats per minute.</strong></em></p>
<p>Meaning for any age, the actual maximum heart rate for 1 standard deviation representing 68% of the population is within 10 beats above or 10 beats below the calculated maximum heart rate.</p>
<p>For example, the maximum heart rate for a 40-year-old is calculated to be 180 beats per minute, but in reality 68% of all 40-year-olds will have a true maximum heart rate between 170 and 190 beats per minute and 95% of the population, representing 2 standard deviations will have a true maximum heart rate between 160 and 200 beats per minute.</p>
<p><em><strong>A directly measured maximum heart rate obtained during a maximal graded exercise test provides the greatest accuracy.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>However, when this is not feasible or safe, methods to estimate maximum heart rate are acceptable.</em></p>
<p>Several other regression equations have been developed, some of which may offer more precision in comparison to the 220-age formula.</p>
<p>The accuracy of each equation will be greatest when applied to individuals having characteristics similar to the study group from which the equation was developed.</p>
<p>The formula developed by Gellish and colleagues (2007) has been noted as providing greater accuracy:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>206.9 - (0.67 x age) = HRmax</code></li>

<h4 id="rating-of-perceived-exertion">Rating of Perceived Exertion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rating-of-perceived-exertion">#</a></h4>
<p>Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) was first introduced by Gunnar Borg and has since become widely used in a variety of fitness and clinical exercise settings.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>RPE provides a subjective indication regarding the difficulty of the exercise being performed by the participant.</em></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="category-scale">Category Scale<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#category-scale">#</a></h5>
<p>The original RPE scale, known as the Category Scale, includes a 15-point range of values from 6 to 20, which was intended to loosely correspond to heart rates ranging from 60 to 200 beats per minute.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>moderate- to vigorous-intensity</strong> physical activity and exercise, which is recommended for most adults, <strong>ranges from 12 to 17</strong> on the category scale.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="category-ratio-scale">Category-Ratio Scale<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#category-ratio-scale">#</a></h5>
<p>More recently, a revised rating of perceived exertion scale, known as the Category-Ratio Scale, was introduced. This revised scale provides a range of values from 0 to 10.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>moderate-intensity</strong> corresponds to a rating of <strong>5 to 6</strong></li>
<li><strong>vigorous-intensity</strong> corresponds to a rating of <strong>7 to 8</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The category-ratio scale has gained popularity due to its relative simplicity, which allows for ease of use and understanding by lay persons and fitness professionals.</p>

<h2 id="steady-state-v-interval-training">Steady State v. Interval Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#steady-state-v-interval-training">#</a></h2>
<p>The foundation of cardiorespiratory endurance is a well-developed aerobic base.</p>
<p><em>Aerobic base is often defined as the level at which the body utilizes fat most efficiently as a substrate for energy production during aerobic (i.e., oxygen-dependent) exercise.</em></p>
<h3 id="steady-state">Steady State<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#steady-state">#</a></h3>
<p>The aerobic base is initially developed through <strong>steady state</strong> exercise sessions. For most individuals seeking the health and general fitness benefits of cardiorespiratory exercise, this is <strong>the primary training strategy</strong>.</p>
<p>During steady state exercise, a <strong>moderate-intensity is sustained at a fairly constant level over a continuous period of time</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, following an appropriate 10-minute warm-up, the exercise intensity may be increased to the level eliciting a heart rate equivalent to 70% of HRmax, which is sustained for 30 minutes followed by a 5-minute cool-down period.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod5/Steady.png"/> 
</figure>

<h3 id="interval-training">Interval Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#interval-training">#</a></h3>
<p>Having established a solid aerobic base through regular steady state exercise, <strong>interval training</strong> may also be used as an effective strategy to further increase cardiorespiratory endurance (i.e., VO2max) and anaerobic threshold.</p>
<p>An interval training session involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>a series of relatively <strong>short vigorous-intensity</strong> bouts of exercise, called <strong>work intervals</strong>, which are alternated with <strong>low-intensity active recovery intervals</strong></li>
<li>during the <strong>work interval</strong>, the exercise intensity is quickly elevated above the anaerobic threshold, typically <strong>85% to 95% of HRmax</strong>, for approximately 10 seconds to 3 minutes</li>
<li>this bout of vigorous-intensity exercise is immediately followed by an <strong>active recovery interval</strong> performed at <strong>50% to 60% of HRmax</strong></li>
<li>each pair of work and recovery intervals is called a <strong>cycle</strong></li>
<li>each interval cycle is expressed as a <strong>ratio of work-to-recovery (work:recovery)</strong></li>
<li>for example, a work interval lasting for 45 seconds followed by a 90 second recovery is expressed as a 1:2 work-to-recovery ratio</li>
</ul>
<p>The duration of the work interval and the ratio of work-to-recovery are based on many factors such as the participant&rsquo;s level of fitness, motivation, and fitness goal, as well as the desired training effect.</p>
<p><em>A very short interval (e.g., 10 to 20 seconds) will stimulate a training effect specific to the phosphagen system; whereas, relatively longer intervals (e.g., 30 seconds to 3 minutes) will lead to adaptations within the anaerobic glycolysis energy system.</em></p>
<p>The intensity of the work interval and work-to-recovery ratios should allow for <strong>5 to 8 cycles</strong> to be completed within a workout.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, a 40-minute interval workout:</p>
<ul>
<li>beginning with a 10-minute warm-up</li>
<li>followed by seven cycles of 1-minute work and 2 minutes 30 seconds recovery</li>
<li>concluding with a 5 to 7 minute cool-down</li>

<li>benefits of and adaptations to resistance training</li>
<li>guidelines for resistance training program design</li>
<li>acute training variables</li>
<li>several resistance training program models</li>
<li>concept of periodization</li>

<h2 id="benefits-of-resistance-training">Benefits of Resistance Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#benefits-of-resistance-training">#</a></h2>
<p>A significant body of scientific evidence demonstrates the many benefits of regular resistance training. Many of these health benefits are similar to those observed with regular cardiorespiratory exercise, yet some are unique benefits specific to resistance training.</p>
<ul>
<li>The mechanical loading applied to the bones during resistance training provides a stimulus to increase bone mineral density and subsequently lowers the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.</li>
<li>Among older adults, resistance training also reduces the risk of falling and injuries sustained from falls.</li>
<li>This is attributed to improved neuromuscular coordination and balance resulting from regular resistance training among all age categories.</li>
<li>Resistance training decreases the risk of non-exercise-related injuries, and may reduce the risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis.</li>
<li>Resistance training enhances athletic performance and preserves or increases functional capacity to perform activities of daily living as well as maintenance of independence and quality of life among aging adults.</li>
<li>Finally, regular muscle-building activities increase lean body mass resulting in improved body composition and resting metabolic rate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="training-adaptations">Training Adaptations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#training-adaptations">#</a></h2>
<p>Regular resistance training will result in one or more overarching adaptations, which are specific to the nature of the training stimulus applied to the body.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Muscular Endurance (local muscular endurance)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to exert repeated contractions against a submaximal resistance over time</li>
<li>local muscular endurance is developed by lifting a relatively light resistance for a high number of repetitions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Muscular Strength (maximal muscular strength)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the maximal amount of force a muscle or group of muscles can generate during a specific movement at a specific velocity</li>
<li>maximal muscular strength is developed by lifting heavy weights for a low number of repetitions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hypertrophy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the increase in the cross-sectional area of a muscle fiber (and the overall muscle size) resulting from an increase in the contractile proteins actin and myosin</li>
<li>hypertrophy is developed though resistance training programs involving both intensity and volume overload</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<ul>
<li><strong>increasing the speed (reduced time)</strong> or</li>
<li><strong>increasing the resistance</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>therefore, power is developed by
<ul>
<li><strong>increasing the speed of movement</strong>, or</li>
<li><strong>lifting a heavier resistance with the same or greater movement speed</strong> than one would use with a lighter resistance</li>

<h3 id="muscle-actions">Muscle Actions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#muscle-actions">#</a></h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a moment to quickly review the types of muscle actions presented in section one of module two:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Concentric</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the phase of an isotonic resistance training exercise during which the <strong>muscle shortens as the external resistance is lifted</strong></li>
<li>also called the <strong>positive phase</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eccentric</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the phase of an isotonic resistance training exercise during which the <strong>muscle lengthens as the external resistance is lowered</strong>, in a controlled manner against gravity</li>
<li>also called the <strong>negative phase</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Remember, when performing a resistance training exercise with a fixed weight such as a dumbbell, barbell, or plates on a selectorized machine, the weight always</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>moves up during the concentric phase and</em></li>
<li><em>down during the eccentric phase</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isometric</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a muscle action during which force is produced, but no movement occurs and the length of the muscle does not change</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="principles-of-training">Principles of Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#principles-of-training">#</a></h3>
<h4 id="principle-of-progressive-overload">Principle of Progressive Overload<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#principle-of-progressive-overload">#</a></h4>
<p>An essential element to any exercise program is the application of sufficient overload.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Principle of Overload</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Indicates that in order to stimulate muscles to adapt, the targeted muscle or group of muscles must be subjected to a &ldquo;stress&rdquo; (e.g., weight, workload, training stimulus) greater than that which is normally encountered</em></li>
<li><em>Overload is often thought of in terms of resistance applied to the muscle during an exercise, but overload may also arise from repetitions or overall volume of training</em></li>
<li>Gains in muscular fitness will continue as long as the training stimulus remains effective, which requires increasing the &ldquo;stress&rdquo; in some manner such as the resistance, repetitions, or volume</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Principle of Progression</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Indicates that as the muscles adapt to the current &ldquo;stress&rdquo;, the workload must be gradually progressed in order to stimulate further adaptation and improvement*</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Overload and progression are closely tied to one another.</em> Often times these principles are stated together as the <strong>Principle of Progressive Overload</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Progressive overload is illustrated nicely by the fable of Milo of Croton…</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Nearly 2,500 years ago, there was a man of incredible strength and athleticism roaming the hills of southern Italy. His name was Milo of Croton, and he was almost certainly the most successful wrestler of his day. Milo was a six-time wrestling champion at the Ancient Olympic Games in Greece. To become the greatest wrestler in Greece, Milo had to train like the rest of us, well perhaps not using exactly the same methods. However, his method did involve progressive overload.  According to legend, Milo began his training by lifting a newborn calf on his shoulders and carrying it daily. As the calf grew, so did Milo&rsquo;s strength, and eventually he could lift and carry the now full grown ox upon his back.</p>

<h4 id="said-principle">SAID Principle<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#said-principle">#</a></h4>
<p>Another important principle of resistance training is <strong>specificity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Principle of Specificity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Indicates that the physiologic adaptations in response to resistance training are specific to the type of &ldquo;stress&rdquo; or overload, and the manner in which it is applied to the body</em></li>
<li>In other words, the amount of carryover from a resistance training exercise to a specific physical task or measurement of performance depends on the specificity of the exercise</li>
<li>The greater the similarity of biomechanical movement and muscle fiber recruitment patterns between an exercise and the daily task, sport activity, or assessment the greater the specificity and carryover</li>
<li>Also referred to as the <strong>SAID</strong> Principle - <strong>S</strong>pecific <strong>A</strong>daptations to <strong>I</strong>mposed <strong>D</strong>emands</li>
<li>There are many aspects of specificity that influence the physiologic and physical improvement arising from a resistance training exercise or program:</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="muscle-group-specificity">Muscle Group Specificity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#muscle-group-specificity">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the most obvious is muscle group specificity</li>
<li>To attain improvements in muscular endurance, strength, and/or power, <em>specific muscle groups must be directly subjected to an overload stimulus</em></li>
<li>An exercise targeting the biceps will do nothing to cause adaptation in the gastrocnemius</li>
<li>In general, multi-joint exercises have a greater specificity and carryover to motor performance tasks than single-joint exercises</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="muscle-action-specificity">Muscle Action Specificity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#muscle-action-specificity">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Muscle action specificity indicates that gains in muscular fitness are in part specific to the type of muscle action used in training</li>
<li>For example, isometric actions, isotonic, which includes both concentric and eccentric actions, or isokinetic</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="joint-angle-specificity">Joint Angle Specificity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#joint-angle-specificity">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Closely related is the concept of joint angle specificity indicating that strength gains are greatest at or near the joint angle at which the overload is applied</li>
<li>This is most obvious with isometric actions</li>
<li>For example, if performing an isometric contraction of the biceps at 90 degrees of elbow flexion, the strength gains attained will be greatest at or near this specific joint angle</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="velocity-specificity">Velocity Specificity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#velocity-specificity">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Velocity specificity is the concept that resistance training produces the greatest gains in strength and power at the velocity or speed at which the training is performed</li>
<li>This suggests that athletes should at some point include higher velocity resistance training movements to mimic their sport</li>
<li>For someone interested in obtaining general strength gains, an intermediate velocity of movement (i.e., tempo) is generally recommended</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="energy-system--metabolic-specificity">Energy System / Metabolic Specificity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#energy-system--metabolic-specificity">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>Finally, resistance training can also elicit adaptations specific to the metabolic systems predominately used to supply energy to the muscle during the exercise</li>
<li>This is known as energy system specificity or metabolic specificity</li>
<li>During resistance training, the energy is predominantly supplied by the <strong>anaerobic energy systems</strong> including the <strong>phosphagen system</strong> and <strong>anaerobic glycolysis</strong></li>
<li><em>The intensity and duration of each set will influence anaerobic energy system contribution:</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy resistance</strong> lifted for a <strong>low number of repetitions</strong> per set is likely to rely on the <strong>phosphagen system</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lighter resistance</strong> lifted for a <strong>higher number of repetitions</strong> will rely more so on <strong>anaerobic glycolysis</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Rest period duration will also influence energy system demands such that shorter rest periods, as seen with circuit training, will also stimulate increased aerobic capacity</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="size-principle">Size Principle<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#size-principle">#</a></h4>
<p><em>According to the size principle of motor unit recruitment, the smaller motor units or muscle fibers, having a low threshold for activation, are recruited first when the demand for muscular force is presented.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low threshold motor units</strong> are composed of <strong>type I muscle fibers</strong></li>
<li>Then, progressively higher threshold motor units are recruited based on the increasing demands for force or power</li>
<li><strong>Higher threshold motor units</strong> are comprised of the larger <strong>type II muscle fibers</strong></li>
<li>Order of motor unit and muscle fiber recruitment is important from a practical perspective</li>
<li>First, to recruit <strong>type II fibers</strong> to achieve a training effect in those fibers, the resistance training exercise must involve <strong>heavy loading and/or high power output demands</strong></li>
<li>In addition, the muscle fiber recruitment order and pattern is fixed (i.e., specificity) for many movements including resistance training</li>
<li>Therefore, variation in exercise and recruitment order is necessary to optimize gains in overall muscular fitness</li>
<li>And this leads us to the next principle of training…</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="variation-principle">Variation Principle<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#variation-principle">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The planned, strategic, and meaningful changes to one or more acute training variables or elements of the program</li>
<li>Although a consistent stimulus is necessary for adaption to occur, over time variation in the program is needed to achieve optimal gains</li>
<li>Variety in exercise programming may be reflected in the:
<ul>
<li>choice of exercise</li>
<li>type of equipment</li>
<li>order of exercise</li>
<li>intensity</li>
<li>volume</li>
<li>rest periods</li>
<li>tempo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="periodization-principle">Periodization Principle<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#periodization-principle">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A systematic manipulation of these training variables to optimize gains, while minimizing overtraining and potential injury</li>
<li>We will revisit periodization of training later in this section</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="reversibility-principle">Reversibility Principle<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#reversibility-principle">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>If the overload stimulus is absent for an extended period of time, the physiologic adaptations attained from training will be gradually lost</li>
<li>Although a planned short-term reduction of the overload (either by decreasing the intensity and/or volume of training as seen in a periodized program) may result in immediate performance improvements, <em>removing the physiologic or physical stress for an extended period of time is likely to cause a loss of the training adaptations or</em> <strong>&ldquo;detraining&rdquo;</strong></li>
<li>The detraining effects of inactivity may be influenced by several factors such as individual characteristics, health status, injury, level of physical fitness, training experience, and lifestyle behaviors</li>
<li>This is known as the principle of reversibility, reflected by the statement:
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you don&rsquo;t use it, you lose it.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="acute-training-variables">Acute Training Variables<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#acute-training-variables">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Acute Training Variables</strong> (also known as <strong>Acute Program Variables</strong>) refers to <em>a group of variables that can be manipulated and used to describe a resistance training exercise, session, or program</em>.</p>
<p>These variables include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>choice of exercises</li>
<li>order of exercises</li>
<li>number of sets</li>
<li>number of repetitions per set</li>
<li>intensity or workload</li>
<li>rest between sets</li>
<li>rest between exercises</li>
<li>tempo or repetition speed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="choice-of-exercise">Choice of Exercise<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#choice-of-exercise">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The choice of exercise relates to the targeted muscle(s), biomechanical characteristics, neuromuscular stimulus, and desired adaptation</li>
<li>For example, exercises may be selected based on type of equipment (e.g., free weight versus machine), targeted body part, primary or secondary muscles, structural whole body movements, type of muscle action, or multi- or single-joint exercises</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="order-of-exercise">Order of Exercise<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#order-of-exercise">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The order of exercises is an important element of workout and program design</li>
<li>It has been suggested that exercising the large muscle groups first provides a superior training stimulus for all of the muscles involved</li>
<li>Classically, multi-joint exercises are performed at the beginning of the workout followed by single joint exercises later in the routine</li>
<li>The rationale, similar to large to small muscle group recommendations, is that multi-joint exercises require the greatest amount of muscle mass and energy for optimal performance</li>
<li>Likewise, complex or high skill exercises should precede simple or low skill exercises, respectively</li>
<li>Many popular resistance training systems, largely focused on exercise order, will be discussed later</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="repetition">Repetition<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#repetition">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A repetition is <strong>one complete motion</strong> of an exercise, typically consisting of two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the concentric muscle action</strong></li>
<li><strong>the eccentric muscle action</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A repetition maximum, or RM, is the maximal number of repetitions that can be performed in one set with proper lifting technique</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, with a given amount of resistance, if a participant could successfully complete 10 repetitions, but was unable to complete the 11th, then he or she would have completed a 10-repetition maximum set</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 1-RM typically represents an individual&rsquo;s maximal muscular strength for a given exercise</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="intensity">Intensity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#intensity">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The intensity of a resistance training exercise is <strong>estimated as a percentage (%) of the one-repetition maximum (1-RM) or a specific repetition maximum (RM) resistance for an exercise</strong></li>
<li>For healthy, untrained individuals a minimum intensity of 60% 1-RM is typically necessary to elicit increased muscular strength; whereas, ≥ 80% of 1-RM results in maximal strength gains for weight-trained individuals</li>
<li><em>It is often more practical to establish and monitor intensity of resistance training using a repetition maximum target zone:</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repetition maximum target zone</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>corresponds to the resistance necessary to elicit volitional muscle fatigue or momentary muscular failure within the desired repetition range</em></li>
<li>For example, using a repetition maximum target zone of 8- to 10-RM, the participant will experience volitional muscle fatigue by the 8th repetition and momentary muscular failure at the 10th repetition</li>
<li>A repetition training zone is a target range of typically three repetitions (e.g., 8-10, 10-12) corresponding to a resistance that allows the person to complete the desired number of repetitions with relative ease or resulting in volitional muscle fatigue</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="resistance-training-continuum">Resistance Training Continuum<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#resistance-training-continuum">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>In accordance with the principle of specificity, <strong>the intensity of the resistance training will influence the training adaptation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Maximal muscular strength is developed using high intensity resistance training corresponding to 3- to 5-RM training zones</li>
<li>Lighter loads such as 12-RM or lighter, have smaller effects on strength development, but are very effective for increasing local muscular endurance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The strength gains achieved above 25 repetitions per set are typically small to nonexistent</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod5/Continuum.png"/> 
</figure>

<h3 id="tempo">Tempo<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tempo">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Tempo (or cadence) refers to the speed at which each repetition is performed</li>
<li>Repetition speed is dependent on training resistance, fatigue, and training goals, and has been shown to significantly affect neuromuscular and metabolic adaptations to resistance training</li>
<li>As demonstrated by the force-velocity curve, force production and repetition speed have a direct inverse relationship such that concentric force production is higher at lower speeds and lower at higher speeds</li>
<li>For general gains in muscular fitness, self-determined repetition speeds that are slow, controlled and deliberate should be used</li>
<li>However, for power development and sport-specific training adaptations, higher velocities using lower resistance is necessary</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="set">Set<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#set">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A set is a group of repetitions performed consecutively without stopping or rest</li>
<li>A set can range from 1 to 20 or more repetitions</li>
<li>Although a single set per exercise group may provide an adequate training stimulus during the initial stages of a resistance training program, <strong>2-4 sets per muscle group are recommended</strong> for most adults to improve strength and power</li>
<li>The duration of rest periods between sets and exercises is an important acute training variable that influences strength development:
<ul>
<li>A short rest period significantly increases the metabolic, hormonal, and cardiovascular responses to resistance training</li>
<li>However, short rest periods may also compromise the development of maximal strength and power since fatigue will inhibit force production and activation of higher threshold motor units</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="frequency-1">Frequency<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#frequency-1">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Frequency refers to the number of times certain resistance training exercises or muscle groups are trained per week</li>
<li>Many factors influence the optimal frequency for resistance training such as:
<ul>
<li>volume</li>
<li>intensity</li>
<li>training status</li>
<li>nutrition</li>
<li>recovery ability</li>
<li>training goals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A frequency of 2 to 3 days per week for each muscle group has been shown to elicit maximal strength gains in untrained individuals</li>
<li>Appropriate rest periods between resistance training sessions is necessary for optimal adaptation and avoidance of overtraining</li>
<li>Therefore, <strong>≥ 48 hours of recovery is recommended between sessions for any given muscle group</strong></li>
<li>The rationale will be explained further in the next section</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="super-compensation-cycle">Super Compensation Cycle<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#super-compensation-cycle">#</a></h3>
<p><em>The acute response to the training stimulus of resistance training is a functional decrease in strength below the baseline level due to breakdown of muscle tissue.</em></p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod5/Compensation.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>During the recovery period, typically lasting 36-72 hours after training session, the body adapts and repairs the muscles, “super compensating” to a level slightly above the initial baseline.</li>
<li>The next training stimulus again causes a temporary decrease in functional capacity followed by another period of repair, recovery, and adaptation “super-compensating” once again above the newly established baseline.</li>
<li>Inadequate rest may contribute to over-training since the muscles are not allowed sufficient time to repair and adapt.</li>
<li>This results in a downward trending baseline or at best a plateau in strength and functional capacity.</li>
<li>If too much time elapses before the subsequent training stimulus (i.e., workout), then the super-compensation will fade, leading to involution, or a reduction in the individuals performance capacity.</li>
<li>In other words, the super-compensation gained from the previous training session will be lost.</li>
<li><strong>Selye&rsquo;s General Adaptation Syndrome</strong> states:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If a stress or bout of exercise is experienced by a system, the system will respond with a temporary decrease in performance followed by restitution returning to or above the initial level of physical fitness</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This enhancement of physical fitness is termed <strong>supercompensation</strong> and is the primary purpose of all training interventions where an improvement in physical fitness is sought.</li>
<li>If the applied stress remains at the same <strong>magnitude (intensity, volume and frequency)</strong> the system will accommodate to this stress and no further improvements in physical fitness will occur.</li>
<li><em>To avoid this accommodation, training programs must be varied over time.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resistance-training-guidelines">Resistance Training Guidelines<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#resistance-training-guidelines">#</a></h2>
<p>The guidelines for resistance training presented, summarizes the key recommendations from the ACSM:</p>
<p><em><strong>Select a minimum of 8 to 10 exercises targeting the major muscle groups</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Multi-joint exercises affecting more than one muscle group and targeting both agonist and antagonist muscle groups are recommended</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Single joint exercises may also be included, typically after performing multi-joint exercises for a particular muscle group</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Most adults should train each muscle group for a total of 2 to 4 sets with 8 to 12 repetitions to improve strength and power</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Older adults and very deconditioned individuals should perform 1 or more sets of 10-15 repetitions</li>
<li>Initially, a single set can be effective for increasing strength in older adults and novice exercisers; however, continued strength gains are attained more effectively when performing multiple sets</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Resistance training for each major muscle group should be performed 2 to 3 days per week on nonconsecutive days separated by at least 48 hours for any single muscle group</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Rest periods of 2 to 3 minutes between sets/exercises are effective, but may vary based on training objective, health/fitness status, and intensity of resistance training</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Adhere as closely as possible to the specific technique and postural alignment for each exercise</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Perform a full (pain-free) range of motion for all exercises</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Adhere to safe range of motion observing biomechanical and anatomic limitations</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Perform both the concentric and eccentric phases of each exercise in a slow, deliberate, and controlled manner</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Maintain normal breathing pattern throughout the exercise</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not hold your breath or perform the Valsalva maneuver</li>
<li>Exhale during the concentric and inhale during the eccentric phase</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>A gradual progression of greater resistance, and/or more repetitions per set, and/or increasing frequency is recommended</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>The specific method of progression may be related to the desired outcome (e.g., strength, power, endurance, hypertrophy), as well as the health/fitness status and training history of the participant</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="circuit-training">Circuit Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#circuit-training">#</a></h4>
<p>The order of exercise is among the acute training variables that may be altered within a resistance training session. The order of exercises will influence the training stimulus and also provide variety to maintain the interest and motivation of the exerciser.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>A time-efficient strategy that is used to elicit strength, endurance, and metabolic adaptations is circuit training.</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally speaking, circuit training consists of a series of resistance exercises performed in succession at a low- to moderate-intensity with minimal rest between sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Circuit resistance training is often designed as a total body workout using an upper to lower body alternating exercise order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sample total body circuit training routine is provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Following a 10-minute cardiorespiratory warm-up, the circuit begins with the leg press, moving as indicted to each subsequent exercise.</li>
<li>The participant complete 1 set of each exercise performing 12-15 repetitions to near muscle fatigue.</li>
<li>Approximately 15-20 seconds of rest is allowed between sets.</li>
<li>Completing just a single set of each exercise, this workout may be referred to as an “Express Circuit”.</li>
<li>This circuit may also be repeated in the same exercise order for a second or third set of each exercise, or the participant may utilize a traditional set-rest-set to complete two sets of each exercise before moving to the next exercise.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod5/Resistance.png"/> 
</figure>

</li>
<li>
<p>The circuit may also be designed to alternate resistance training exercises with aerobic exercise stations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The participant begins by completing an adequate 10-minute aerobic warm-up.</li>
<li>This sample circuit training routine begins with the stability ball squat performed for 45 seconds or until volitional muscle fatigue.</li>
<li>The participant then proceeds to the next station of 12 inch stepping for 45 seconds.</li>
<li>Continue progressing through each station.</li>
<li><em>If conducting with a single participant, then the resistance exercise stations may be completed to an established repetition range.</em></li>
<li><em>If conducting with a small group of participants, then timed stations are ideal to keep all participants moving from station to station in unison.</em></li>
<li>In the case of small group training, each participant will need to begin their circuit at a different resistance exercise station.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod5/Cardio.png"/> 
</figure>

</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="super-sets">Super Sets<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#super-sets">#</a></h4>
<p>Another common strategy within a resistance training session is super sets. Super-set training involves alternating between two exercises, typically targeting opposing muscle groups or movements with minimal rest between sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Traditional Super-Set</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Includes alternate sets of two exercises for <strong>agonist and antagonist muscle groups</strong></li>
<li>For example, the leg extension machine and the prone leg curl machine, or a dumbbell biceps curl and a cable triceps pushdown are both super-sets involving single joint agonist paired with its single joint antagonist muscle group</li>
<li>The seated row and a dumbbell chest press, or a lat pulldown and a dumbbell shoulder press are both super-sets involving a multi-joint pull exercise paired with a multi-joint push exercise</li>
<li>The bench press may be performed with an arm curl machine, creating a multi-joint push and single joint pull super-set</li>
<li>Similarly, a stability ball squat may be super-setted with a stability ball leg curl, or a dumbbell shoulder press with a dumbbell biceps curl</li>
<li>Finally, a lat pulldown and a cable triceps pushdown is an example of a multi-joint pull - single joint push super set</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stacking</strong> (or <strong>Compound Sets</strong>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Another type of super-set involves alternate sets of two exercises for the <strong>same muscle group or body part</strong></li>
<li>For example, a push-up and a cable chest fly, a seated row and a reverse fly, or a body weight dip and a triceps pushdown</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>One advantage of super-set training is time efficiency when compared to traditional set-rest-set-rest training.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pyramids">Pyramids<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pyramids">#</a></h4>
<p>Pyramid training is a strategy often used by power lifters to develop strength and power specific to the bench press, dead lift, and squat. However, the pyramid concept may be applied to other exercises and used by other populations as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<h3 id="periodization-of-training">Periodization of Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#periodization-of-training">#</a></h3>
<p>Periodization of training refers to the planned and systematic changes in the acute program variables.</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary goals of periodization:
<ul>
<li>maximize the training effect to promote optimal fitness and performance</li>
<li>manage fatigue to prevent training plateaus and overtraining</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Periodized training programs are broken down into <em><strong>three primary components</strong></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Macrocycle (the annual training program)</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>represents the entire training period, often ranging from 6 months to 1 year or longer</li>
<li>comprised of several <em>mesocycles</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Mesocycles (a phase of the macrocycle or monthly plan)</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>represents a smaller training period, each of which may last from several weeks to months and is focused on a specific training goal such as endurance, strength, or power</li>
<li>made up of smaller <em>microcycles</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Microcycles (the weekly training plan)</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>typically represents 1 week blocks of training or even individual workout sessions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally speaking, two types of periodization are commonly utilized:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear Periodization</strong> (also called <strong>Classic Periodization</strong>)
<ul>
<li>progressively increases training intensity as the corresponding training volume decreases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nonlinear Periodization</strong> (also called <strong>Undulating Periodization</strong>)
<ul>
<li>more frequent changes in training intensity and volume, often from one workout session to the next</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="linear-periodization">Linear Periodization<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#linear-periodization">#</a></h4>
<p>The table provided outlines the phases or cycle of a linear periodization model:</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod5/Linear.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>The first row indicates the phases of a linear model using the typical European terminology</li>
<li>The second row indicates the phases using traditional American terminology</li>
<li>The third row indicates the phases using the American strength/power model terminology</li>
<li>The bottom of the table provides the general parameters for the acute training variables as they correspond to the American strength/power linear periodization model</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that many variations of these linear models have been developed for various sports and individual athletes. This table simply provides a schematic overview of common underlying models that guide most linear periodization training programs.</p>
<p><em>A key characteristic of linear periodization is an initial high volume and low intensity with gradual increases in intensity and decreases in volume within and across training periods.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Linear periodization is often effectively applied to sport-specific training programs for athletes.</li>
<li>A potential limitation to a well-designed linear program for health-seekers and fitness enthusiasts is inconsistency of training, which disrupts the linear progression and continuity of the program.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="nonlinear-periodization">Nonlinear Periodization<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nonlinear-periodization">#</a></h4>
<p>This table outlines possible nonlinear periodization models:</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod5/Nonlinear.png"/> 
</figure>

<p><em>The intensity of each week or training session is typically defined by the repetition-maximum (RM) target range applied to most exercise sets within the respective phase.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>12-15 RM sets may be conceptualized as a “low” intensity or “light” resistance</li>
<li>8-10 RM may be considered a “moderate” intensity or resistance</li>
<li>4-6 RM a “high” intensity or “heavy” resistance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Similar to linear periodization, as the intensity increases, the volume decreases.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>So, the volume of training is high during a low-intensity week or day, on the other hand the volume of training is low on a high-intensity week or day.</li>
<li>Rest periods between sets and exercises also correspond to intensity:
<ul>
<li>low-intensity resistance training will require shorter rest periods (e.g., 20-60 seconds)</li>
<li>high-intensity resistance training will require longer rest periods (e.g., 2-3 minutes)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The convenience, flexibility, and variety offered by nonlinear periodization has contributed to its gain in popularity among participants seeking fitness-oriented goals.</p>
<p><em>Both linear and nonlinear periodization strategies may also be implemented following contemporary approaches focused on stabilization-, strength-, and power-oriented training, which is summarized next.</em></p>
<h3 id="resistance-training-progressions">Resistance Training Progressions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#resistance-training-progressions">#</a></h3>
<p>The ability to stabilize the kinetic chain, both statically and dynamically, is the foundation for efficient movement.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod5/Progression.png"/> 
</figure>

<h4 id="stabilization">Stabilization<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#stabilization">#</a></h4>
<p><em><strong>Therefore, the initial stage of a resistance training program for a novice client should focus on stabilization-oriented exercises.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>This stage of training utilizes exercises for the basic movement patterns utilizing the major muscle groups in a multi-joint fashion.</li>
<li>The focus is on lower-intensity resistance training to develop foundational muscular endurance, motor learning of movement patterns, and kinesthetic awareness.</li>
<li>Stabilization-oriented resistance training exercises challenge one&rsquo;s ability to maintain joint alignment and posture while lifting and lowering an external resistance.</li>
<li>Stabilization-oriented exercise are progressed by introducing greater instability to the exercise.</li>
<li>Since the resistance is relatively light, stabilization-oriented exercises tend to involve higher-repetition sets, therefore exercises of this nature also contribute to increased muscular endurance.</li>
<li>Stabilization-oriented core exercises are those that do not involve movement of the spine:
<ul>
<li>For example, planks, bridges, bird-dogs</li>
<li>These exercises are progressed by increasing instability, movement of the arms and/or legs, and/or increasing the exercise repetition time under tension (i.e., duration of the exercise)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="muscular-strength">Muscular Strength<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#muscular-strength">#</a></h4>
<p>The next stage of training focuses on muscular strength development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strength-oriented exercises are more stable allowing for the use of relatively heavier weights, lifted for a lower number of repetitions per set.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, these exercises tend to be more traditional, such as free weights and machines.</li>
<li>Strength-oriented exercises are progressed by increasing the intensity or the workload (i.e., amount of weight lifted).</li>
<li>As training volume increases, strength-oriented resistance training also promote muscle hypertrophy.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="power">Power<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#power">#</a></h4>
<p>Eventually, and when appropriate for the client, training may progress to include power-oriented exercises.</p>
<p><em>Muscular power training shifts the training methods to enhance rate of force development (i.e., speed and explosiveness) utilizing a relatively low % of 1-RM.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This type of training enhances neuromuscular adaptations and increases sports performance.</li>
<li>Exercises may be plyometric in nature an utilize tools such as medicine balls.</li>
<li>Although power may be increased by increasing the external workload, power-oriented exercises are often progressed by increasing the rate of force production, in other words, the speed of movement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pillars-of-resistance-training-program-design">Pillars of Resistance Training Program Design<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pillars-of-resistance-training-program-design">#</a></h3>
<p>Resistance training programs may be built around four basic pillars, generally corresponding to movement patterns, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower body exercises</strong></li>
<li><strong>Upper body pushing exercises</strong> typically involving the chest, shoulders and/or triceps</li>
<li><strong>Upper body pulling exercises</strong> typically involving the upper back and/or biceps</li>
<li><strong>Core or rotational exercises</strong></li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod5/Pillars.png"/> 
</figure>

<p><em>Exercises that incorporate <strong>two or more movement patterns</strong>, are <strong>multi-planar</strong> in nature, and involve <strong>acceleration, deceleration and stabilization</strong>, are <strong>representative of “functional” exercises</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Keeping these major exercise categories in mind can help guide basic resistance training program design.</p>
<h2 id="programming-design-needs-analysis">Programming Design Needs Analysis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#programming-design-needs-analysis">#</a></h2>
<p>The personal trainer&rsquo;s resistance training ‘toolbox' contains countless exercises, programming methodologies and a seemingly infinite number of progressions or modifications. For the novice personal trainer it may be overwhelming trying to decide which exercises and training strategies will be most effective for a client.</p>
<p><em><strong>Before designing a resistance training program or workout, what does the personal trainer need to know about their client?</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Health &amp; Fitness Goals?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>What are the client&rsquo;s health and fitness goals?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Health Status?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>What is the client&rsquo;s current health status? Does the client have any known illness, disease, or other medical considerations?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Orthopedic Issues?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Does the client have any orthopedic issues or limitations?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Level of Fitness?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>What is the client&rsquo;s currently level of fitness?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exercise &amp; Activity History?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>What is the client&rsquo;s exercise and activity history? Does he or she have past experience with resistance training?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exercise Preferences?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>What are the client&rsquo;s preferences - likes and dislikes with regard to specific exercises?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sport-Specific Needs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Does the client have sport- or occupational-specific needs?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What Else?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>What else might you need to consider when designing a resistance training program?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the knowledge gained from this section combined with insights about a client obtaining during the initial intake, preparticipation screening, and fitness assessment, the personal trainer may begin to construct resistance training programs that are both safe and effective for their clients.</p>

<h1 id="section-4-flexibility-training">Section 4: Flexibility Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-4-flexibility-training">#</a></h1>
<p>Section four will review:</p>
<ul>
<li>potential benefits of flexibility training</li>
<li>types of stretching exercises</li>
<li>guidelines for flexibility training to increase range of motion</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits-of-flexibility-training">Benefits of Flexibility Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#benefits-of-flexibility-training">#</a></h2>
<p>An appropriate level of flexibility is necessary for health, fitness, and in some cases performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper postural alignment and neuromuscular efficiency are dependent upon a normal length-tension relationship among muscle groups.</li>
<li>Many activities of daily living, such as getting in and out of a car, necessitate an adequate level of joint range of motion.</li>
<li>In addition, certain sports and activities, such as dance, gymnastics, wrestling, and diving, require a high degree of flexibility for optimal performance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The proposed benefits of flexibility training include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Restoration and/or maintenance of muscle balance necessary for proper postural alignment</li>
<li>Decreased muscular tension and musculotendinous stiffness</li>
<li>Reduced joint stress</li>
<li>May reduce the risk of musculoskeletal injury</li>
<li>Reduced incidence of low back pain</li>
<li>Facilitation of physical and mental relaxation</li>
<li>Increased performance in sports and activities, which require a high degree of flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Although most of the proposed benefits of stretching are generally accepted, in recent years some research has challenged these long-held beliefs.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>In particular, several studies have suggested that static stretching performed before or after exercise does not reduce the risk of injury or the severity of delayed onset muscle soreness.</li>
<li>In addition, many researchers have studied the impact of static stretching on athletic performance, especially with regard to maximal force production, sprint speed, and vertical jump height as a measure of power.</li>
<li>The results of these studies suggest that pre-activity static stretching acutely decreases muscle strength, slows sprint speed, and reduces vertical jump height.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This is not to suggest that stretching exercise should be avoided.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, stretching to maintain or improve range of motion continues to be an important component of health-related physical fitness.</li>
<li>However, the type and timing of flexibility exercises is an important consideration when designing an exercise program.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sensory-receptors">Sensory Receptors<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sensory-receptors">#</a></h2>
<p>Before introducing the various types of flexibility training, it is necessary to briefly review the sensory receptors that mediate the physical and physiologic responses to stretching exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Two important sensory receptors include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>muscle spindles</li>
<li>Golgi tendon organs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="muscle-spindles">Muscle Spindles<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#muscle-spindles">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>Muscle spindles are sensory receptors located within the skeletal muscle that are sensitive to changes in length and rate of length change.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Stretch Reflex:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>When stimulated by a sudden lengthening of the muscle, the muscle spindles will cause a reflexive contraction of the muscle in an effort to prevent injury that may result from over-stretching or stretching too rapidly.</em></li>
<li>For example. this can be seen when a doctor uses a rubber mallet to tap the patellar tendon causing a reflexive contraction of the quadriceps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reciprocal Inhibition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The motor unit stimulation and subsequent contraction of a muscle is accompanied by simultaneous decrease in neural drive and <strong>deactivation of the opposite muscles</strong>, in this case the hamstrings, <strong>causing antagonist muscle relaxation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="golgi-tendon-organs-gto">Golgi Tendon Organs (GTO)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#golgi-tendon-organs-gto">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>Golgi tendon organs (GTO) are sensory receptors located in the musculotendinous unit that are sensitive to changes in muscular tension and the rate of tension change.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>When stimulated by rapidly increasing or excessive tension, the Golgi tendon organs cause the muscle to relax, thus preventing excessive stress and potential injury.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Autogenic Inhibition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The neural response that causes the muscle&rsquo;s own receptors to cause the relaxation</li>
<li>Stimulation of the Golgi tendon organs <strong>inhibits activation of the muscle spindle fibers within the same muscle, which leads the relaxation of the muscle</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-stretches-and-flexibility-training">Types of Stretches and Flexibility Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#types-of-stretches-and-flexibility-training">#</a></h2>
<p>A variety of flexibility exercises are used to increase joint range of motion including stretching techniques such as static, ballistic, dynamic, and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF).</p>
<p>In addition, self-myofascial release is also used to increase flexibility using tools such as a foam roller.</p>
<h3 id="static">Static<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#static">#</a></h3>
<p>Static stretching is perhaps the most common mode of flexibility training used by fitness professionals and is generally regarded as a safe and effective method to increase range of motion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Static stretching involves moving a muscle into a lengthened position causing mild discomfort, but not pain, which is held for an extended period of time, typically 10-30 seconds.</li>
<li>Static stretches may be performed either:
<ul>
<li><strong>actively</strong> or</li>
<li><strong>passively</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="active">Active<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#active">#</a></h4>
<p><em>During an active stretch the targeted muscle is lengthened using internal force generated by activation of the antagonist muscles.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the hamstrings may be lengthened to elicit an active stretch by positioning the hip at approximately 90 degrees of flexion and then actively contracting the quadriceps to gently extend the knee.</li>
<li><em>The contraction of the agonist muscle causes efferent nerve impulses to inhibit antagonist muscle activation leading to relaxation of the antagonist muscle group via reciprocal inhibition.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="passive">Passive<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#passive">#</a></h4>
<p><em>A passive stretch relies upon an external force provided by an unrelated body part, a personal trainer, or a device (e.g., stretching strap, wall, ballet barre), to position a body segment such that a stretch is applied to the targeted muscle.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, with the client lying supine on a mat or stretching table, the personal trainer lifts the client&rsquo;s leg with the knee extended, moving the hip into flexion until a stretch is felt through the hamstrings.</li>
<li><em>The passive lengthening of the hamstring muscles creates tension, which stimulates the GTOs and leads to relaxation of the hamstrings via autogenic inhibition.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dynamic">Dynamic<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dynamic">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>Dynamic stretching exercises utilize slow, controlled, and rhythmic movements to actively increase joint range of motion.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic stretches are typically performed during the pre-activity warm-up to replicate certain sport-specific and functional movements. These activities utilize:
<ul>
<li><strong>body weight or light resistance</strong>, such as a medicine ball or resistance tubing, and</li>
<li><strong>involve calisthenic type movements</strong> such as body weight squats, walking and lateral lunges, and medicine ball chops and lifts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dynamic range of motion activities may also involve single-joint movements such as shoulder circles or leg swings.</li>
<li>The dynamic nature of these activities also function to increase tissue temperature, elasticity, and extensibility, which are likely to contribute to increased range of motion and decreased risk of injury during exercise.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ballistic">Ballistic<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ballistic">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>Ballistic stretching techniques utilize rapid bouncing movements in an effort to lengthen and stretch the targeted muscle.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Ballistic stretching may be counter-productive to improvements in joint range of motion since the ballistic movements may initiate the stretch reflex causing the effected muscle to contract, restricting range of motion.</li>
<li>In addition, if ballistic stretches are performed too aggressively or are not preceded by a proper warm-up, they may cause unnecessary muscle soreness and potentially lead to musculotendinous injury.</li>
<li>For these reasons, ballistic stretching is typically not recommended for improving range of motion among those seeking improved health and fitness.</li>
<li>However, ballistic stretching may confer some improvements in range of motion and performance among athletes, particularly those participating in sports or activities that involve ballistic-type movements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proprioceptive-neuromuscular-facilitation-pnf">Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#proprioceptive-neuromuscular-facilitation-pnf">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) includes several variations of stretching techniques that couple passive static stretching and muscle activation.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>An example of a PNF stretching technique is the <strong>&ldquo;contract relax&rdquo; method</strong>, which typically refers to a <strong>passive stretch of the targeted muscle</strong>, followed by an <strong>isometric contraction of the targeted muscle</strong>, which is then followed by another <strong>passive stretch of the same muscle</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="self-myofascial-release-smr">Self-Myofascial Release (SMR)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#self-myofascial-release-smr">#</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>Self-myofascial release (SMR) is a technique during which an individual uses their own body weight to apply pressure to a targeted muscle using a foam roller or similar device.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the common SMR exercises using a foam roller target the quadriceps, gluteals, iliotibial band, and calves.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guidelines-for-flexibility-training">Guidelines for Flexibility Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#guidelines-for-flexibility-training">#</a></h2>
<p>The following guidelines should be observed for flexibility training, in particular when performing static stretching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility training is more effective when preceded by an adequate warm-up</li>
<li>A series of flexibility exercises should be performed targeting each of the major muscle groups</li>
<li>Flexibility exercises should be performed at least 2-3 days per week with daily being most effective</li>
<li>Stretch to the point of tightness or mild discomfort, but not pain</li>
<li>Holding a static stretch for 10-30 seconds is recommended for most adults</li>
<li>It is recommended that each flexibility exercise is performed 2 to 4 times per session, with a target of 60 seconds total time for each flexibility exercise</li>
</ul>
