  "articleBody": "Section 1: Six Essential Nutrients Section one will review the six essential nutrients necessary for optimal health, fitness and performance. These include carbohydrates, fats, protein, vitamins, minerals, and water.\nCarbohydrates Including Dietary Fiber Carbohydrates serve as a primary source of energy for the body and the skeletal muscles.\nCarbohydrates are categorized as either simple sugars or complex carbohydrates.\nSimple Sugars Simple sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides.\n Monosaccharides:  Glucose Fructose (also known as fruit sugar) Galactose (a monosaccharide that is less sweet than glucose and fructose)       Disaccharides  Formed when two monosaccharides are joined together Common examples of disaccharides include:  A glucose plus a fructose which makes sucrose (also known as table sugar)    A glucose plus a galactose which makes lactose (also known as milk sugar)    A glucose plus a glucose which makes maltose (also known as malt sugar)         Complex Carbohydrates Complex Carbohydrates (or Polysaccharides) is a long chain of monosaccharides.\nComplex carbohydrates include:\n Starch  found in plant-based foods such as grains, potatoes, vegetables   Glycogen  found in meats    Starch and glycogen are the only two polysaccharides that humans can fully digest\n  The starch and glycogen in the foods we eat is digested into glucose\n Glucose is either used for energy or stored for future use Extra glucose is stored in the form of glycogen in the skeletal muscle and liver The stored glycogen is used to produce energy during exercise    Carbohydrates are a preferred source of energy for the body, providing approximately 4 calories per gram of carbohydrate\n  The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range for adults ages 19 years and older indicates that 45% to 65% of daily calories should be obtained from carbohydrates.\n  The best food sources are those that contain complex carbohydrates and are nutrient dense, such as vegetables and whole grains as well as fruits.\n  Dietary Fiber Dietary fiber is the non-digestible form of carbohydrates found in beans and peas, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and nuts.\nFiber is classified as either soluble or insoluble:\n  Soluble Fiber\n include those found in oats, legumes, apples, citrus fruits, strawberries, and carrots    Insoluble Fiber\n found in whole wheat, bran, and vegetables    The fiber found in the foods we eat may help to reduce the risk of several chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.\n  The Adequate Intake for dietary fiber is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories, or 25 grams/day for middle-age women and 38 grams/day for middle age men.\n  Protein The primary function of protein is to build and repair tissues and other structures within the body.\nAmino Acids are the structural components or “building blocks” of protein. There are approximately 20 amino acids used by the body to construct various proteins:\n Essential Amino Acids  approximately 8 to 10 that must be consumed in other words, it is essential to eat these amino acids   Nonessential Amino Acids  the remaining 10 are considered to be nonessential since the body is able to synthesize these amino acids by using nitrogen and components of carbohydrate and fat molecules    Complete \u0026 Incomplete Proteins Complete Proteins are foods that contain all of the essential amino acids.\n Animal-based sources of protein such as lean meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy products are generally complete proteins.  Incomplete Proteins are foods that are lacking one or more of the essential amino acids.\n When combined, incomplete proteins may complement each other to provide all of the essential amino acids. These incomplete protein combinations are referred to as complementary proteins.  For example, peanut butter and whole wheat bread, or brown rice and black beans. A variety of plant-based, complementary proteins consumed over the course of a day can provide all of the essential amino acids. These complementary proteins do not need to be consumed at the same time to provide the essential building blocks for protein.    Protein Intakes Like carbohydrates, protein provides approximately 4 calories per gram.\nHowever, although protein may serve as a source of energy, the majority of energy needs are typically satisfied through adequate intake and availability of carbohydrates and fats.\n  The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range for protein among adults ages 19 years and older is 10% to 35% of their daily calories.\n  Lean sources of meat and poultry should be selected to decrease intake of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol.\n  In addition, a Recommended Dietary Allowance for protein has been established as 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.\n  However, active individuals and athletes are likely to have greater protein needs to facilitate repair and building of lean tissue:\n Endurance-Trained Athletes consume 1.2 to 1.4 g/kg/day Strength-Trained Athletes should consume 1.2 up to 1.7 g/kg/day Example:  The protein intake range for a 175 pound (79.5 kg) male triathlete is calculated as follows:  79.5 kg x 1.2 g/kg/day = ~95 grams of protein  this is the lower limit for this athlete’s daily protein intake   79.5 kg x 1.4 g/kg/day = ~111 grams of protein  this is the upper limit for this athlete’s daily protein intake   Recommended intake for this endurance-trained athlete is 95 to 111 grams of protein per day           Recommended Protein Intake      Adult General Population 0.8 g/kg/day   Endurance-Trained Athletes 1.2 - 1.4 g/kg/day   Strength-Trained Athletes 1.2 - 1.7 g/kg/day    Fats Fat is an important macronutrient serving many functions including energy production, temperature regulation, cell structure, nerve transmission, vitamin absorption, and hormone production.\n However, too much dietary fat also increases the risk of many chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The majority of dietary fats and fats stored within the body are in the form of triglycerides, which consist of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule. Fatty acids are either saturated or unsaturated in nature based on the presence or absence of carbon-carbon double bonds and the corresponding number of hydrogen atoms.  Saturated Fats Saturated fats do not contain any carbon-to-carbon double bonds and are therefore “saturated” with hydrogens.\n Saturated fats are typically solid at room temperature such as those found in animal-based foods such as red meat and full-fat dairy products, but are also found in tropical oils such as coconut and palm. A high consumption of saturated fat is associated with increased levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the “bad” cholesterol. Subsequently, high saturated fat intake has also been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.  Unsaturated Fats Unsaturated fats contain one or more carbon-to-carbon double bonds.\n  Monounsaturated fat contains just one of these double bonds; whereas, a\n  Polyunsaturated fat contains two or more double bonds.\n  Unsaturated fats are typically liquid at room temperature and are found in plant-based foods such as olive, corn, soybean, canola, peanut, and safflower oils.\n  Unsaturated fats are often considered ‘healthy oils' since they help to decrease total serum cholesterol, decrease the bad LDL cholesterol, and increase the good high density lipoprotein, HDL cholesterol.\n  Essential fatty acids are polyunsaturated fats that must be consumed in the diet such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.\n Omega-3 fatty acids are found in cold water fish and shellfish. Like other polyunsaturated fats, Omega-3 and Omega 6- fatty acids provide health benefits such as improved immune system function and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.    Fat Intake Fat is the most energy-dense macronutrient, providing approximately 9 calories per gram.\n The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range for fat among adults ages 19 years and older is 20% to 35% of their daily calories. This corresponds to a fat intake range of approximately 45 to 78 grams of fat per day for the reference 2,000 calorie intake diet pattern. It is also recommended that consumption of saturated fatty acids should be limited to less than 10% of daily calories. Most individuals will benefit from a small shift from foods that are high in saturated fat to foods rich in monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids.  Trans Fats Trans fatty acids are another type of fat which are found naturally in some foods from ruminant animals such as cattle and lamb.\n Trans fats are also produced during the hydrogenation process used by food manufacturers to convert vegetable oils into semi-solid fats having a longer shelf-life. Sources of trans fatty acids may include commercially prepared baked goods, fried foods, margarine, and snack foods. A number of research studies have demonstrated an association between trans fatty acid intake and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, Americans are encouraged to keep their intake of trans fatty acids “as low as possible.\"  Vitamins In addition to the three macronutrients, vitamins and minerals represent two additional essential nutrient groups.\nVitamins are organic, carbon-based micronutrients essential for the maintenance of normal physiological processes and health.\nThere are 13 different vitamins essential to the human body, most of which can only be obtained through the foods we eat.\nVitamins are classified into the water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins:\n Water-Soluble Vitamins  Include the B-complex vitamins, vitamin C, and choline With the exception of vitamins B6 and B12, water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body and are readily excreted in urine. This decreases the risk of toxicity from overconsumption, but also increases the need for regular intake.   Fat-Soluble Vitamins  Include vitamins A, D, E, and K Fat-soluble vitamins are often found in fat-containing foods and stored in the liver or adipose (fat) tissue for extended periods of time. The storage increases the risk of toxicity from overconsumption, but decreases the risk of deficiency.    Each vitamin has unique functions within the body, may be found in a variety of foods, and must be consumed at a specific quantity to meet the body’s needs.\n   Water-Soluble Fat-Soluble     Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) Vitamin A   Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) Vitamin D   Vitamin B3 (Niacin) Vitamin E   Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid) Vitamin K   Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) -   Vitamin B9 (Folic Acid) -   Vitamin B12 -   Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) -   Choline -    A comprehensive review of the vitamin-specific functions, food sources, and recommended intake levels is beyond the scope of this module. We encourage you to refer to up-to-date credible sources such as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, for detailed information regarding specific vitamins.\nVitamin D Vitamin D is a unique nutrient in that it is produced by the body through sunlight on the skin.\n However, in the U.S., particularly in more northern locations, most vitamin D is obtained from dietary sources such as fortified foods including milk and yogurt. Adequate vitamin D is necessary for skeletal health. Although vitamin D has been the topic of much scientific research over the recent years, evidence is inconclusive with regard to the many non-skeletal health benefits suggested to arise from increased vitamin D intake. Although the average dietary intake of vitamin D is estimated to be less than the recommended level, the majority of the U.S. population is meeting their requirements for vitamin D through a combination of dietary sources and sunlight exposure. Nevertheless, most Americans are likely to benefit from modest increases to vitamin D intake. The RDA for vitamin D is as follows:  15 µg/day (600 IU/day) for youth and most adults 20 µg/day (800 IU/day) for adults over 71 years    Minerals Minerals are inorganic micronutrients essential for the maintenance of a variety of structures and functions throughout the body.\n The dietary minerals are important components of the bones, teeth, muscles, blood, and nerve cells. Minerals can be found in a variety of foods such as dairy products, meat, cereal and whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and nuts. Dietary minerals are needed to work in conjunction with vitamins to ensure good nutrition and optimal health.  Minerals are classified as either major minerals or trace minerals based on the recommended intake amounts:\n Major Minerals (also called Macro Elements)  Include calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium major minerals needed in large amounts   Trace Minerals (also call Micro Elements)  include chromium, copper, fluoride, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc trace minerals in small amounts    Each mineral has a unique function within the body, may be found in a variety of foods, and must be consumed at a specific quantity to meet the body’s needs.\n   Major Minerals Trace Minerals     Calcium Chromium   Chloride Copper   Magnesium Fluoride   Phosphorus Iron   Potassium Manganese   Sodium Molybdenum   - Selenium   - Zinc    A comprehensive review of the mineral-specific functions, food sources, and recommended intake levels is beyond the scope of this module. We encourage you to refer to up-to-date credible sources such as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, for detailed information regarding specific dietary minerals.\nCalcium Calcium is a macromineral responsible for functions such as nerve transmission, skeletal muscle contraction, vasoconstriction and vasodilation of blood vessels, and heart rhythm.\n In addition, adequate intake of calcium is critical for optimal skeletal health. A significant proportion of the U.S. population is at risk for osteoporosis due to low bone density. Low calcium intake is of particular concern among youth ages 9 and older, adolescent girls, adult women, as well as all adults over the age of 51. The Recommended Dietary Allowance for adults is 1,000 to 1,200 mg/day depending on age and gender. All age groups are encouraged to meet their RDA for calcium by increasing consumption of fat-free or low-fat dairy products and/or alternative calcium sources (e.g., calcium-fortified orange juice, dark green vegetables, whole almonds).  Sodium Sodium is an essential macromineral needed by the body for fluid balance, acid-base balance, contraction of the heart, and conduction of nerve impulses.\n However, excessive sodium intake causes a proportional increase in blood pressure and subsequent risk for the development of hypertension. Nearly all Americans are estimated to over-consume sodium with the average estimated intake of 3,400 mg per day among those 2 years and older. Although a small proportion of the sodium consumed by Americans comes from salt added to foods at the table or during preparation, most sodium comes from processed foods such as yeast breads, chicken mixed dishes, pizza, pasta dishes, and luncheon meats.  Americans should strive to do the following:\n Reduce daily sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg/day and further Reduce intake to 1,500 mg/day among persons who are 51 and older and those of any age who are African American or have hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease  Potassium Whereas dietary intake of sodium is known to be excessively high in the American diet, intake of potassium is generally low.\n Dietary potassium can counteract the negative effects of sodium on blood pressure. In light of the health benefits of adequate dietary potassium, many would benefit from increased consumption of potassium-rich foods such as baked potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, prunes, oranges, and bananas. The Adequate Intake level for potassium for adults is 4,700 mg per day.  Dietary Reference Intakes In 1995, the United States (the Institute of Medicine) and Canada (the Office of Nutrition Policy and Promotion of Health Canada) began collaboration to establish a uniform set of nutrient-based Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).\n The purpose of the DRIs is to identify the nutrient intake levels that will promote health, prevent or delay diet-related chronic disease, and avoidance of nutrient overconsumption. The DRIs create the scientific basis for public policy such as nutritional labeling, fortification of foods, and menu-planning for school meal programs. In addition, the DRIs were used in the creation of The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Patterns, and the MyPlate graphic. The DRIs include four nutrient reference values to be used for assessing and planning the dietary needs of individuals and groups. These values include:  Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) Adequate Intake (AI) Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)    Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)  Estimated Average Requirement represents the average daily intake that is likely to meet the nutritional requirements of approximately half of the healthy population. It is not used as an individual nutrient recommendation or a goal, but rather is used for statistical analysis when setting the RDAs.  Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)  Recommended Dietary Allowance is established at a level which meets the nutrient requirements of nearly all healthy individuals (95% or two standard deviations from the EAR). As such, the RDA will exceed the nutrient needs for most healthy people in the population and intakes below the RDA do not necessarily indicate a deficiency.  Adequate Intake (AI)  When there is insufficient scientific evidence to establish an RDA, an adequate intake level is set based on the levels of nutrients consumed by apparently healthy individuals. Although the AI is a less exact measure than an RDA, it is believed to be adequate for nearly all healthy individuals within the population.  Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)  Tolerable Upper Intake Limit represents the highest average level of nutrient intake that does not pose any risk of adverse health effects. Intakes above the UL increase the risk of nutrient toxicity.  Water Water is the most important nutrient. It is crucial for life, health, and optimal athletic performance.\nAs the most abundant molecule in the body, water is critical for many physiological functions throughout the body.\n Water is essential for:  Regulation of body temperature Absorption and transportation of nutrients Digestion and elimination of waste products Maintenance of blood volume Water serves as the medium for all biochemical reactions and metabolic processes throughout the body    Fluid Intake and Exercise Under normal conditions, most adults need at least 8 to 10, eight ounce glasses (64-80 fl. oz/day) of water per day.\n Fluid intake must be increased in conjunction with exercise and athletic activities, especially when performed in hot and humid environments. The fluid intake recommendations provided are adapted from both the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Athletic Trainers Association.  Before exercise…  Drink 5-7 mL per kilogram of body weight at least 4 hours before exercise. Consume beverages with sodium and/or salted snacks to stimulate thirst and to retain needed fluids.   During exercise…  The amount and rate of fluid replacement depends upon the individual sweating rate, exercise duration, and environment. Individuals should monitor body weight changes during exercise and competition to estimate sweat losses with respect to environmental conditions. As a general rule, drink ad libitum (freely) from 14-27 fl. oz./hr. (~400-800 mL/hr.) based on body size, pace/intensity, and environment. For prolonged exercise, “sports beverages” are recommended containing electrolytes (sodium, potassium) and carbohydrates (~5-10% concentration).   After exercise…  Drink ~1.5 L of fluid for each kilogram of body weight lost (24 oz. fluid per pound lost). Consume beverages and snacks with sodium to stimulate thirst and fluid retention for rapid and complete recovery.       Section 2: Dietary Guidelines for Americans Section two will overview the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are published jointly by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nThe Guidelines The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have jointly published the Dietary Guidelines for Americans every five years since 1980. Although the early editions were published voluntarily, federal law was passed in 1990 requiring the DGA to be reviewed, updated, and republished every five years. Although many of the DGA recommendations have remained relatively consistent over time, the Dietary Guidelines have evolved as research has grown and scientific knowledge has advanced. The first several editions of the DGA were relatively simple consumer-oriented brochures. However, in recent years the DGA have expanded and shifted toward more specific recommendations supported by an extensive evidence-based review process conducted by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.\n  The main purpose of the Dietary Guidelines is to inform the development of Federal food, nutrition, and health policies and programs.\n It is written for policymakers, as well as nutrition, exercise, and health professionals, not the general public. The Dietary Guidelines is a critical tool for professionals to help Americans make healthy choices in their daily lives to help prevent chronic disease and enjoy a healthy diet. It’s recommendations are ultimately intended to help individuals improve and maintain overall health and reduce the risk of chronic disease - its focus is disease prevention. The Dietary Guidelines is not intended to be used to treat disease. Regardless of an individual’s current health status, almost all people in the United States could benefit from shifting choices to better support healthy eating patterns. Thus, the Dietary Guidelines may be used by fitness professionals to encourage healthy eating patterns for clients, club members, and class participants.  The current 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines were released on January 7th, 2016.\n    The Dietary Guidelines is designed for professionals to help all individuals ages 2 years and older and their families to consume a healthy, nutritionally adequate diet.\n  A focus of the recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans is on healthy eating patterns and their food and nutrient characteristics.\n  The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines provides five overarching Guidelines that encourage healthy eating patterns, recognize that individuals will need to make shifts in their food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy pattern, and acknowledge that all segments of our society have a role to play in supporting healthy choices.\n  These Guidelines also embody the idea that a healthy eating pattern is not a rigid prescription, but rather, an adaptable framework in which individuals can enjoy foods that meet their personal, cultural, and traditional preferences and fit within their budget.\n  The Five Overarching Guidelines include:\n Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan   (Covered in Chapter 1 of the DGA Policy Document) All food and beverage choices matter Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease  Focus on variety, nutrient density, and amount   (Covered in Chapter 1 of the DGA Policy Document) To meet nutrient needs within calorie limits, choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods across and within all food groups in recommended amounts  Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake   (Covered in Chapter 1 of the DGA Policy Document) Consume an eating pattern low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within healthy eating patterns  Shift to healthier food and beverage choices   (Covered in Chapter 2 of the DGA Policy Document) Choose nutrient-dense foods and beverages across and within all food groups in place of less healthy choices Consider cultural and personal preferences to make these shifts easier to accomplish and maintain  Support healthy eating patterns for all   (Covered in Chapter 3 of the DGA Policy Document) Everyone has a role in helping to create and support healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to communities  Key Recommendations Key Recommendations provide further guidance on how individuals can follow the five Guidelines.\nThe first Key Recommendation is to consume a healthy eating pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level.\nHealthy Eating Pattern A healthy eating pattern includes:\n  Variety of vegetables from all of the subgroups\n Healthy eating patterns include a variety of vegetables from all five vegetable subgroups including dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy, and other. Include all fresh, frozen, canned and dried options in cooked or raw forms, including vegetable juices. Vegetables should be consumed in a nutrient-dense form, with limited additions such as salt, butter, or creamy sauces. The recommended amount of vegetables in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 2½ cup-equivalents per day.    Fruits, especially whole fruits\n Include fresh, canned, dried, or frozen fruits The recommended amount of fruits in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 2 cup-equivalents per day.    Grains, at least half of which are whole grains\n The recommended amount of grains in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 6 ounce-equivalents per day. When refined grains are chosen, they should be enriched.    Fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or fortified soy beverages\n Increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk or yogurt and decreasing the proportion that is cheese would decrease saturated fats and sodium and increase potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin D provided from the dairy group. The recommended amount of dairy in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is based on age rather than calorie level. For adolescents ages 9 to 18 years and for adults, the recommendation is 3 cup-equivalents per day.    A variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts, seeds, and soy products\n The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce-equivalents per day.    Oils\n Including: canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils. Oils also are naturally present in nuts, seeds, seafood, olives, and avocados. Oils are fats that contain a high percentage of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are liquid a room temperature. Although they are not a food group, oils are emphasized as part of healthy eating patterns because they are a major source of essential fatty acids and vitamin E. The recommendation for oils in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 27 grams (about 5 teaspoons) per day.    A healthy eating pattern limits: Saturated fats and trans fats, added sugars, and sodium.\nQuantitative Key Recommendations that are quantitative are provided for several components of the diet that should be limited.\nThese components are of particular public health concern in the United States, and the specified limits can help individuals achieve healthy eating patterns within calorie limits.\nThese quantified key recommendations include:\n  Consume less than 10 percent of calories per day from added sugars\n The added sugars recommendation is a target based on food pattern modeling and national data on intakes of calories from added sugars. This target demonstrates the public health need to limit calories from added sugars to meet food group and nutrient needs within calorie limits. When added sugars exceed 10% of calories, a healthy eating pattern may be difficult to achieve.    Consume less than 10 percent of calories per day from saturated fats\n The recommendation to consume less than 10 percent of calories per day as saturated fats is a target based on evidence that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. However, replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates is not associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Individuals should limit intake of trans fats to as low as possible by limiting foods that contain synthetic sources of trans fats, such as partially hydrogenated oils, and by limiting other solid fats.    Consume less than 2,300 milligrams per day of sodium\n Americans are encouraged to follow the age- and sex-appropriate Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for sodium set by the Institute of Medicine. The UL is 2,300 milligrams per day for individuals ages 14 years and older. The recommendations for children younger than 14 years of age are the age- and sex-appropriate Upper Limits, which vary from 1,500 to 2,200, depending on age. For adults with hypertension or prehypertension, further reduction to 1,500 mg per day can result in greater blood pressure reduction.    If alcohol is consumed, it should be consumed in moderation, defined as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.\n Alcohol should only be consumed by adults of legal drinking age. It is not recommended that individuals begin drinking or drink more for any reason, and there are many circumstances in which individuals should not drink, such as during pregnancy.    Eating Patterns A focus of the recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans is on healthy eating patterns and their food and nutrient characteristics.\nAn eating pattern represents the combination of foods and beverages that constitute an individual’s complete dietary intake over time.\nThroughout the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines, the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is used to illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food groups and other dietary components that make up healthy eating patterns.\nOther examples of healthy eating patterns include:\n Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Eating Plan  The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans reflects for the first time a robust body of scientific evidence on overall eating patterns and chronic disease.\nHealthy eating patterns support a healthy body weight and can help prevent and reduce the risk of chronic disease throughout periods of growth, development, and aging as well as during pregnancy.\nThe following principles of healthy eating patterns apply to meeting the Key Recommendations:\n  An eating pattern represents the totality of all foods and beverages consumed\n All foods consumed as part of a healthy eating pattern fit together like a puzzle to meet nutritional needs without exceeding limits, such as those for saturated fats, added sugars, sodium, and total calories. All forms of foods, including fresh, canned, dried, and frozen, can be included in healthy eating patterns. Eating patterns are more than the sum of their parts and may be more predictive of overall health and disease risk than individual foods or nutrients.    Nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods\n Individuals should aim to meet their nutrient needs through healthy eating patterns that include nutrient-dense foods. Foods in nutrient-dense forms contain essential vitamins and minerals and also dietary fiber and other naturally occurring substances that may have positive health effects. In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements may be useful in providing one or more nutrients that otherwise may be consumed in less than recommended amounts.    Healthy eating patterns are adaptable\n Individuals have more than one way to achieve a healthy eating pattern. Any eating pattern can be tailored to the individual’s socio-cultural and personal preferences.    Shifting Toward Healthy Eating Patterns Chapter 2 of the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans policy document focuses on current food intakes among Americans and the shifts needed for Americans to align with healthy eating patterns. As such, chapter 2 focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline: Shift to healthier food and beverage choices.\nMaking changes to eating patterns can be overwhelming. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that every food choice is an opportunity to move toward a healthy eating pattern. Small shifts in food and beverage choices over the course of a week, a day, or even a meal can make a big difference.\nHere are a few examples of realistic shift strategies that can help people adopt healthy eating patterns:\n Shift from High Calorie Snacks to Nutrient-Dense Snacks Shift from Fruit Products with Added Sugars to Whole Fruit Shift from Refined Grains to Whole Grains Shift from Snacks with Added Sugars and Salt to Unsalted Snacks Shift from Solid Fats to Healthy Oils Shift from Beverages with Added Sugars to No-Sugar Added Beverages  Support Healthy Eating Patterns for All Collective action is needed to create a new paradigm in which healthy lifestyle choices at home, school, work, and in the community are easy, accessible, affordable, and normative.\nEveryone has a role in helping individuals shift their everyday food, beverage, and physical activity choices to align with the Dietary Guidelines.\nChapter 3 of the Dietary Guidelines policy document focuses on the fifth Guideline: Support healthy eating patterns for all.\n  As shown in the Social-Ecological Model, a multitude of choices, messages, individual resources, and other factors affect the food and physical activity choices an individual makes, and these decisions are rarely made in isolation.\nThe scientific literature has described a number of specific circumstances that can limit an individual’s or family’s capacity to choose a healthy diet.\nThese contextual factors - food access, household food insecurity, and acculturation - are particularly important for millions of individuals living in the United States.\nAs appropriate, fitness professionals can consider these critical factors when developing strategies and providing education to enhance the adoption of healthy eating patterns and regular physical activity.\nTo shift from current eating patterns to those that align with the Dietary Guidelines, collective action across all segments of society is needed.\nThese actions must involve a broad range of sectors, occur across a variety of settings, and address the needs of individuals, families, and communities.\nThese actions include:\n identifying and addressing successful approaches for change improving knowledge of what constitutes healthy eating and physical activity patterns enhancing access to adequate amounts of healthy, safe, and affordable food choices and promoting change in social and cultural norms and values to embrace, support, and maintain healthy eating and physical activity behaviors  My Plate The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a long history of producing food guidance graphics intended to support healthy dietary choices.\nFrom the Basic Seven Guide to Good Eating of the 1940s, to the Basic Four Daily Food Guide of the 1950s and 60s, the Hassle-Free Daily Food Guide of the 70s, followed by the original Food Guide Pyramid of the early 90s, and then the MyPyramid: Steps to a Healthier You launched in 2005.\n  The current food guidance graphic is known as MyPlate, which was introduced in 2011.\n    The MyPlate graphic was launched as part of a larger communications initiative based on the 2010 edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\n  MyPlate is still used today in support of the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans to help consumers make better food choices.\n  The MyPlate graphic was developed as the result of consumer research during which most focus groups favored the visual of a simple and familiar mealtime place setting.\n  MyPlate illustrates five food groups on a placemat that is suggestive of proportions:\n fruits vegetables grains protein dairy    “My” continues the personalization approach from the previous MyPyramid icon.\n  Integral to the MyPlate design is the incorporation of the ChooseMyPlate.gov website address where consumers can take advantage of additional resources and apply the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in a personal way.\n  Advantages\n simplicity the visual representation of food group proportionality the emphasis on the need to consume from all food groups it conveys the message to make half your plate fruits and vegetables and the flexibility to tailor meals to different diets    Disadvantages\n difficulty applying MyPlate to mixed dishes such as lasagna or fajitas the graphic does not convey the best food choices within each group it may be more applicable to dinner than to breakfast, lunch, or snacks the graphic does not represent the total day or eating pattern and although it conveys proportionality, it does not represent amount or serving sizes     Section 3: Nutrition Facts Labels Section three will review the current Nutrition Facts label and introduce the new label recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, which went into effect in May 1994, mandated that all pre-packaged foods display a nutrition label, with the exception of foods intended for immediate consumption, such as fresh produce. Presently, the Food and Drug Administration regulates the labeling on all packaged foods, as well as health claims and nutrient content claims. The current regulations require the Nutrition Facts label to include information on serving size, number of servings, total calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sugar, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and trans fat. Information regarding additional nutrients may be included on a voluntary basis.  Interpretation of a Nutrition Facts Label This section provides a sample Nutrition Facts label for educational purposes.\n  Serving Size We will begin our review of the label by looking at the serving size and the number of servings in the package.\n In this case, the serving size is 1 cup and the entire package contains 2 servings (i.e., 2 cups). Generally speaking, serving sizes are standardized to make it easier to compare similar foods. Serving sizes for like foods are provided in similar units, such as cups, fluid ounces, or pieces, followed by the metric amount such as grams or milliliters. The size of the serving on the food package influences the number of calories and all the nutrient amounts listed on the top part of the label. Pay attention to the serving size, especially how many servings there are in the food package. Then ask yourself, “How many servings am I actually consuming”? In the sample label, one serving equals one cup. If you ate the whole package, you would eat two cups. That doubles the calories and other nutrient numbers, including the % Daily Values as shown in the sample label.  Calories and Calories from Fat Next, check the calories and the calories from fat.\n Calories provide a measure of how much energy you get from a serving of this food. Many Americans consume more calories than they need without meeting recommended intakes for a number of nutrients. The calorie section of the label can help consumers manage their weight. Remember, the number of servings consumed determines the number of calories actually consumed. In the example, there are 250 calories in one serving. 110 of the total calories are derived from fat, which means almost half the calories in a single serving come from fat. So, if you eat the entire contents of the package, then you would consume two servings, or 500 calories, and 220 of those calories would come from fat. As a general guide to calories per serving, 40 Calories is low, 100 Calories is moderate, and 400 Calories or more is high. This general guide to Calories provides a general reference for calories when you look at a Nutrition Facts label. This guide is based on a 2,000 calorie diet.  Adequate Nutrient Amounts The nutrients listed in the yellow section are those that Americans generally eat in adequate amounts, or even too much.\n Eating too much fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium may increase the risk of certain chronic diseases, like heart disease, some cancers, or high blood pressure. Therefore, these nutrients should be limited in a healthy eating pattern.  Most Americans don’t consume enough dietary fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron in their diets.\n They are identified in blue as “get enough of these nutrients.” Eating enough of these nutrients can improve your health and help reduce the risk of some diseases and conditions. For example, getting enough calcium may reduce the risk of osteoporosis, a condition that results in brittle bones as one ages. Eating a diet high in dietary fiber promotes healthy bowel function. Additionally, a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain dietary fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease.  Remember, the Nutrition Facts label should be used not only to help limit those nutrients you want to cut back on, but also to increase those nutrients you need to consume in greater amounts.\nFootnote The footnote in the lower part of the nutrition label informs consumers that the “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.”\n This statement must be on all food labels. But the remaining information in the full footnote may not be on the package if the size of the label is too small. When the full footnote does appear, it will always be the same. It doesn’t change from product to product, because it shows recommended dietary advice for all Americans–it is not about a specific food product.  Daily Values Look at the amounts in the footnote–these are the Daily Values (DV) for each nutrient listed and are based on public health experts' advice.\n Daily values are recommended levels of intakes. Daily values in the footnote are based on a 2,000 or 2,500 calorie diet. Note how the DVs for some nutrients change, while others, like cholesterol and sodium, remain the same for both calorie amounts.  Percent Daily Value The column shaded in purple on the right of the label represents the Percent Daily Value for the corresponding nutrients.\n As a general guide, 5% of the Daily Value or less is low for all nutrients, those you want to limit, such as fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium, or for those that you want to consume in greater amounts, such as dietary fiber and calcium. 20% of the Daily Value or more is high for all nutrients. For example, for a 2,000 calorie diet, the daily value for total fat is 65 grams.  This particular food product contains 12 grams of total fat per serving. 12 is 18% of 65, so the % daily value for total fat is 18% in one serving. If the entire container, in other words 2 servings, is actually consumed, then the % daily value is doubled to 36%.   The Percent Daily Value for a specific food should not be confused with the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range for daily fat, carbohydrates, and protein intake. In other words, the 18% Daily Value for total fat in this food does not mean that 18% of the total calories are derived from fat.  Macronutrient Calculation This section will review macronutrient calculations to determine the percent of fat, carbohydrate, and protein calories that are derived from the total calories in one serving.\nTo calculate the % of total calories represented by fat, carbohydrates, and protein, multiply the total grams for each macronutrient by the corresponding caloric value.\nFat Calculation As reported on the Nutrition Facts label, this food product contains 12 grams of total fat.\n Recall that the caloric value of fat is 9 calories per gram. So, 12 grams of fat times 9 calories per gram equals 108 calories from fat. 108 fat calories divided by 250 total calories per serving equals 43% fat. So, 43% of the total calories are derived from fat.  Carbohydrate Calculation This food product contains 31 grams of carbohydrates and each gram of carbohydrate provides 4 calories of energy.\n So, 31 grams of carbohydrates multiplied by 4 calories per gram equals 124 calories from carbohydrates. 124 carbohydrate calories divided by 250 total calories per serving equals 49% carbohydrates. 49% of the total calories are derived from carbohydrates.  Protein Calculation Finally, there are 5 grams of protein per serving and protein provides 4 calories per gram.\n 5 grams of protein times 4 calories per gram equals 20 calories from protein, divided by 250 total calories equals 8% of the total calories are derived from protein.  Add these macronutrient percentages together and we have accounted for 100% of the total calories per serving.\n Remember, the AMDR for fat is 20% to 35% of the daily calories. Relative to this range, at 43%, the proportion of fat in one serving of this food exceeds this upper limit of this recommended range. Even though one serving represents 18% of the Daily Value for fat, the proportion of fat per serving relative to the other macronutrients is fairly high.  Sample Macronutrient Calculations Now, let’s perform macronutrient calculations once again, this time in the form of a multiple choice question.\n An apple cinnamon breakfast bar has 3 grams of fat, 26 grams of carbohydrates, and 1 gram of protein. How many total calories in one bar and what percentage of the total calories are derived from fat?  A. 135 kcal \u0026 20% fat B. 246 kcal \u0026 15% fat C. 30 kcal \u0026 10% fat D. 135 kcal \u0026 35% fat    Using the information provided and recalling the caloric value for each macronutrient, complete the calculations to determine the number of calories derived from each macronutrient.\n  3 grams of fat times 9 calories per gram equals 27 calories from fat.\n  26 grams of carbohydrates times 4 calories per gram equals 104 calories from carbohydrates.\n  1 gram of protein times 4 calories per gram equals 4 calories from protein.\n  Add together the calories from each macronutrient to determine the total calories in one breakfast bar…\n 135 total calories.    Finally, to determine the percent of calories derived from fat…\n 27 fat calories divided by 135 total calories equals 20% fat.    So, the correct answer is response option A.\n Fat: 3g x 9cal/g = 27 calories Carbohydrates: 26g x 4cal/g = 104 calories Protein: 1g x 4cal/g = 4 calories Total Calories = 135 = 27 cal + 104 cal + 4 cal % of calories from fat = 27 / 135 = .20 or 20%    The New Nutrition Facts Label The Nutrition Facts label, introduced over 20 years ago, helps consumers make informed food choices and maintain healthy dietary practices. In May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the new Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information, including the link between diet and chronic diseases such as obesity and heart disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the compliance date for July 26, 2018, with and additional year to comply for manufacturers with annual food sales of less than $10 million. However, on June 13, 2017, the FDA announced its intention to extend the compliance date. The FDA will provide details on the extension through a Federal Register Notice at a later time. Please check the fda.gov website for updates regarding compliance implementation.\n   The “iconic” look of the label will remain, but the FDA is making important updates to ensure consumers have access to the information they need to make informed decisions about the foods they eat. These changes include increasing the type size for “Calories,” “servings per container,” and the “Serving size” declaration, and bolding the number of calories and the “Serving size” declaration to highlight this information. Manufacturers must declare the actual amount, in addition to percent Daily Value of vitamin D, calcium, iron and potassium. They can voluntarily declare the gram amount for other vitamins and minerals. The footnote is changing to better explain what percent Daily Value means. It will read: “The % Daily Value tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice.” “Added sugars,” in grams and as percent Daily Value, will be included on the label. Scientific data shows that it is difficult to meet nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits if you consume more than 10 percent of your total daily calories from added sugar, and this is consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The list of nutrients that are required or permitted to be declared is being updated.  Vitamin D and potassium will be required on the label. Calcium and iron will continue to be required. Vitamins A and C will no longer be required, but can be included on a voluntary basis.   While continuing to require “Total Fat,” “Saturated Fat,” and “Trans Fat” on the label, “Calories from Fat” is being removed because research shows the type of fat is more important than the amount. Daily values for nutrients like sodium, dietary fiber and vitamin D are being updated based on newer scientific evidence from the Institute of Medicine and other reports such as the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report, which was used in developing the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Daily values are reference amounts of nutrients to consume or not to exceed and are used to calculate the percent Daily Value (% DV) that manufacturers include on the label. The %DV helps consumers understand the nutrition information in the context of a total daily diet. By law, serving sizes must be based on amounts of foods and beverages that people are actually eating, not what they should be eating. How much people eat and drink has changed since the previous serving size requirements were published in 1993. For example, the reference amount used to set a serving of ice cream was previously ½ cup but is changing to 2/3 cup. The reference amount used to set a serving of soda is changing from 8 ounces to 12 ounces. Package size affects what people eat. So for packages that are between one and two servings, such as a 20 ounce soda or a 15-ounce can of soup, the calories and other nutrients will be required to be labeled as one serving because people typically consume it in one sitting.  Dual Column Labels For certain products that are larger than a single serving, but that could be consumed in one sitting or multiple sittings, manufacturers will have to provide “dual column” labels to indicate the amount of calories and nutrients on both a “per serving” and “per package”/“per unit” basis.\n Examples would be a 24-ounce bottle of soda, a pint of ice cream. With dual-column labels available, people will be able to easily understand how many calories and nutrients they are getting if they eat or drink the entire package/unit at one time. Dual column labels will also be used for foods in the packaged and prepared forms.

Inadequate physical activity levels and poor nutrition are driving overweight and obesity rates steadily higher, producing corresponding increases in heart disease, diabetes, and other obesity-related diseases.\nHistorical Obesity Trends The graphic below illustrates selected historical Center for Disease Control and Prevention adult obesity prevalence maps based on data collected through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System between 1990 and 2010.\n   Unlike data collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which utilizes a measured height and weight, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System calculates body mass index using self-reported height and weight. Adults are known to underreport weight and over report height, which leads to BMI values biased toward lower than actual values. Subsequently, the actual obesity rates based on this data may be higher than reported. Nevertheless, the trends over time clearly demonstrate a rise in obesity among U.S. adults.  Current Obesity Trends Beginning in 2011, several methodological changes were implemented with the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which are likely to have altered obesity prevalence estimates in comparison to data derived prior these changes.\nFor example, beginning with 2011, data records were excluded from obesity prevalence rates if:\n self-reported height was less than 3 feet or greater than or equal to 8 feet self-reported weight was less than 50 pounds or greater than or equal to 650 pounds calculated BMI was less than 12 kg/m2 or greater than or equal to 100 kg/m2 or women who reported being pregnant  Due to these and other changes, the obesity prevalence maps from 2011 to the present year cannot be compared to those from 2010 and earlier.\nThe graphic below illustrates the U.S. obesity prevalence map for 2015.\n  In 2015…\n No state had a prevalence of obesity less than 20% 6 states and the District of Columbia had a prevalence of obesity between 20% and  19 states and Puerto Rico had a prevalence of obesity between 25% and  21 states and Guam had a prevalence of obesity between 30% and  4 states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and West Virginia) had a prevalence of obesity of 35% or greater  Metabolism and Energy Balance The biochemical process of breaking down macronutrients including carbohydrates, fats, and protein, to provide the energy necessary to sustain life and to support activity is known as metabolism.\nThe energy utilized by the body is often measured in terms of calories.\n A calorie (with a small “c”) is a unit of energy defined as the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius. The “calories” we refer to with regard to the energy content of food and the energy expended through exercise are technically kilocalories. A kilocalorie (kcal) or Calorie (with a large “C”) is 1,000 calories or the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water 1 degree Celsius. In both dietetics and fitness, it is common to interchange the terms “calorie” and “kilocalorie”, although in both cases the actual unit of energy is a kilocalorie.  The total amount of energy burned throughout the course of a day is known as the total daily energy expenditure.\n The total daily energy expenditure is composed of various sources of both involuntary and voluntary caloric expenditure.    Involuntary Caloric Expenditure Approximately 60% of total daily energy expenditure represented by the basal and resting metabolic rates:\n  Basal Metabolic Rate\n defined as the minimum amount of energy needed to sustain basic life functions such as respiration, heart rhythm, blood circulation, and brain activity, while lying at complete rest, in the morning, after sleep, and in a fasted state    Resting Metabolic Rate\n typically about 10% higher than the basal rate and represents the energy expenditure in a resting and fasted state    Thermal Effect of Food (TEF)\n the energy expenditure above RMR related to the digestion, absorption, and storage of the food we eat The thermal effect of food contributes approximately 10% to 15% of the total daily energy expenditure    The BMR, RMR, and TEF can all be considered involuntary components of daily metabolism\nVoluntary Caloric Expenditure The voluntary component of total daily energy expenditure is represented by activity thermogenesis, which includes energy expenditure from exercise-related activity and non-exercise activity thermogenesis.\nExercise-related activities include both structured, intentional exercise as well as leisure time physical activity.\nNon-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (abbreviated as NEAT)\n the energy we expend during everything we do that is not sleeping, eating, structured exercise, or leisure time physical activity NEAT includes energy expenditure associated with activities of daily living, occupational activity, fidgeting, toe-tapping, spontaneous muscular contraction, communication, transportation, and maintenance of posture NEAT represents the most variable component of daily energy expenditure, ranging from 15% of TDEE in very sedentary individuals to ≥ 50% of TDEE in highly active individuals  Energy Balance The maintenance of a healthy body weight and prevention of weight gain is dependent on managing an energy balance between energy intake and energy expenditure.\nEnergy Intake  Energy intake is the sum of all calories ingested through the food that we eat. The macronutrients including carbohydrates, fat, and protein provide the vast majority of the calories in our diet. Alcoholic beverages also account for some additional calories.  Energy Expenditure   Majority of daily caloric expenditure is the result of our resting metabolic rate (typically accounting for 60% to 75% of daily energy expenditure)\n  Thermal effect of digesting food represents approximately 10% of daily energy expenditure\n  Remaining calories are burned through various types of physical activity such as:\n non-exercise activity thermogenesis, activities of daily living, transportation and occupational activity, and leisure-time physical activity and structured exercise    Calories in and calories out remain balanced:\n body weight stays stable with no significant weight gain or loss    Calories in regularly exceeds calories out:\n one is said to be in a positive caloric balance which results in weight gain    Calories out regularly exceeds calories in:\n one is said to be in a negative caloric balance which results in weight loss    Guidelines for Safe Weight Loss Regular leisure-time physical activity and cardiorespiratory exercise play an important role in the maintenance of a healthy body weight and the prevention of obesity.\nThe direct positive impact of physical activity and exercise results from increased energy expenditure during and immediately after activity.\nDepending on body size, level of fitness, and exercise intensity, adults can easily expend an extra 1,000 calories per week by exercising 30 minutes, 5 days per week.\n  An increase in muscle mass as a result of resistance training contributes to the maintenance of or increase in resting metabolic rate.\n Such an increase in metabolic rate may complement the increase in caloric expenditure produced by aerobic exercise training to further assist with weight control. In theory, a gain of 1 kg or 2.2 lbs of muscle mass should increase resting energy expenditure by ~ 21 kcal/day. Over the course of one year this is an additional ~7,665 calories or ~ 2 lbs of potential fat loss.    Regular physical activity can reduce, but not eliminate, the mortality risk of obesity independent of weight loss or BMI.\n This is supported by findings from large longitudinal studies including the Harvard Alumni Health Study, the Nurses' Health Study, and the Women’s Health Study. In addition, studies investigating the role of physical fitness have generally observed that having higher cardiorespiratory fitness can remove the excess risk of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality associated with being overweight or obese. A higher level of cardiorespiratory fitness also protects against weight gain. Findings from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study demonstrate that among both men and women, each minute of improved maximal treadmill endurance time was accompanied by a proportionate reduction in weight gain over the study period and reduced the risk of a weight gain greater than 20 pounds by 21%.    Physical activity is often cited as the best predictor of weight maintenance following weight loss; however, a significant volume of physical activity is often necessary.\nExercise Guidelines The guidelines for physical activity and exercise have been adopted from the American College of Sports Medicine.\nAerobic Exercise   Frequency:\n Aerobic exercise should be performed 5 or more days per week to maximize caloric expenditure.    Intensity:\n The exercise intensity should be moderate-to-vigorous depending on the health status, initial fitness level, and abilities of the participant. Moderate-intensity exercise corresponds to 3 to 5.9 METs or 40 to 60% of HRR. Vigorous-intensity exercise corresponds to ≥ 6 METs or ≥ 60% of HRR.    Time:\n Initially, individuals should be encouraged to complete a minimum of 30 minutes of aerobic activity per day, progressing to 60 minutes per day. Evidence indicates that moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity of 150 to 250 minutes per week with an energy expenditure equivalent to ~1,200 to 2,000 calories per week is sufficient to prevent a weight gain greater than 3% in most adults. For most, physical activity greater than 250 minutes per week is necessary for clinically significant weight loss and to prevent weight gain following weight loss. Most research suggests that more is better regarding the volume of physical activity needed to prevent weight regain after weight loss.    Type:\n The type of aerobic activity should be suitable to the abilities and preferences of the client and should include rhythmic, large muscle group activities with an emphasis on increased caloric expenditure for maintenance of a healthy body weight and achievement of other health benefits.    Resistance Training Resistance training should be considered a supplement to the combination of aerobic exercise and modest reductions in caloric intake to facilitate weight loss. As such, resistance training should be perform in addition to, but not in place of time dedicated to cardiorespiratory exercise. The guidelines for resistance training for obese populations are similar to those recommended for apparently healthy adults.\n  Frequency:\n Resistance training should be performed 2-3 days per week on non-consecutive days separated by at least 48 hours for the same muscle group.    Intensity:\n 8 to 15 repetitions should be performed per set, corresponding to 60% to 80% of one-repetition maximum. Initially, the repetition range should focus on 10-15 repetitions with a relatively lighter weight, progressing to 8 to 12 repetitions with a slightly heavier weight.    Time:\n A specific duration for resistance training sessions has not been established. Initially, 1 set should be performed for each major muscle group, progressing to 2 to 4 sets as tolerated. Each session should consist of at least 8 to 10 exercises targeting the major muscle groups throughout the body.    Type:\n Resistance training should primarily focus on multi-joint exercises affecting more than one muscle group in order to maximize the metabolic demand and time efficiency. Exercises should be selected to target both agonist and antagonist muscle groups.    Additional Recommendations Obese individuals are likely to have one or more comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease or orthopedic limitations. Therefore, it is important to consider precautions and contraindications corresponding with these other conditions.\nIn addition, the American College of Sports Medicine and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics also present the following recommendations for weight loss programs:\n  Target a minimal reduction in body weight of at least 5% to 10% of initial body weight over 3-6 months.\n  Strive for an energy deficit of 500 to 1,000 kcal/day to achieve a weekly weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds.\n This reduced energy intake should be combined with a reduction in dietary fat to However, energy intake should be sufficient to meet the individual’s resting metabolic rate.    Portion control should be included as part of a comprehensive weight management program.\n Portion control at meals and snacks results in reduced energy intake and weight loss.    It may be necessary to accumulate the desired volume of physical activity through multiple daily bouts of at least 10 minutes in duration.\n  Target changing eating and exercise behaviors, as sustained changes in both behaviors result in significant long-term weight loss.\n Incorporate behavioral modification strategies to facilitate adoption and maintenance of desired changes in behavior.    Enhance communication between healthcare professionals, dieticians, and exercise professionals.\n  National Weight Control Registry The National Weight Control Registry is an ongoing study to investigate the strategies and behaviors of individuals successful at long-term maintenance of weight loss.\n The NWCR was established in 1994 by Dr. Rena Wing, the director of the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center at Brown University and Dr. James Hill, the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Colorado. The Registry was developed in part to identify and study the characteristics and strategies of those who have experienced successful maintenance of weight loss. Since its inception, more than 10,000 individuals have been included in the Registry making it the largest longitudinal prospective study of successful weight loss practices. To be eligible for inclusion, participants must be at least 18 years old and have maintained a minimum weight loss of 30 pounds for at least one year.  The NWCR has identified many dietary, physical activity, and behavioral strategies common among successful weight losers. Among these was the finding that Registry participants report a significantly high level of weekly physical activity.\n Overall, more than 90% report exercise as crucial to their long-term weight-loss maintenance. The caloric expenditure derived from physical activity averages nearly 2,700 kcal/wk among NWCR members. This is equivalent to ~60-75 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per day or walking ~ 28 miles per week. Walking is the most commonly reported mode of activity and resistance training is the second most commonly reported, with 52.2% and 29.2% of NWCR members reporting these activities, respectively.  To learn more about the findings of the National Weight Control Registry, visit the National Weight Control Registry website.\nGoal Body Weight Calculations Many clients will have a goal focused on a weight loss outcome. As such, it may be useful to estimate a client’s goal body weight for the purpose of goal-setting.\n A goal body weight may be calculated based on the client’s:  current weight current body composition goal body composition    Step 1 Obtain the client’s current body weight and body composition (or percent of body fat)\n Body composition analysis may be conducted using a variety of procedures including skinfold measurements The assessment of body composition will be discussed in module number four  Step 2 Calculate the current fat weight (or pounds of fat) by multiplying the current total body weight by the current percent of body fat\n Fat Weight = Total Body Weight x % Body Fat  Step 3 Calculate the client’s current lean body weight by subtracting the current fat weight from the current total body weight\n Lean Body Weight = Total Body Weight - Fat Weight  Step 4 Determine the client’s goal percent of lean body weight\n In other words, if the client wishes to decrease the current percent of body fat, then what will be the corresponding percent of lean body weight? The goal percent lean body weight is calculated by subtracting the goal percent body fat from 100% Goal % Lean Body Weight = 100% - Goal % Body Fat  Step 5 Overall weight loss is ideally accomplished by losing fat weight and at minimum by retaining the current lean body weight. Therefore, the fifth and final step is to:\nDivide the current lean body weight by the goal percent of lean body weight, which provides the estimated goal total body weight\n Goal Body Weight = Current LBW / Goal % LBW  Examples Example 1\nNow, let’s perform a sample goal body weight calculation in the form of a multiple choice question.\n  A 40-year old female client currently weighs 170 pounds and has 32% body fat. She would like to decrease her body fat to 26% over the next six months. What is her goal body weight?\n A. 164 lbs B. 156 lbs C. 150 lbs D. 144 lbs    First, multiply her current body weight of 170 pounds by her current percent body fat of 32%\n This indicates that she currently has 54.4 pounds of fat weight    Next, subtract the 54.4 pounds of fat weight from the total body weight of 170 pounds\n This indicates that she currently has 115.6 pounds of lean body weight    Since her goal is to improve her body composition to 26% fat, her goal percent lean body weight is 74%\n Therefore, the final step is to divide her current lean body weight of 115.6 by .74 This estimates her goal body weight at 26% body fat and 74% lean body weight to be 156 pounds    The correct answer above is “B”\n170 lbs x 0.32 = 54.4 lbs of fat weight 170 lbs - 54.4 = 115.6 lbs of lean body weight 115.6 / 0.74 (goal % LBW) = 156 lbs (goal weight)\n  Example 2\nLet’s take look at another example…\n A male client currently weights 230 pounds and his body composition is 22% fat   230 pounds times 22% fat indicates his current fat weight is 50.6 pounds\n 230 lbs x 0.22 = 50.6 lbs of fat weight    Since 50.6 pounds of his current weight is fat, the remaining 179.4 pounds represent lean body weight\n Likewise, since 22% of his current weight is fat, the remaining 78% is lean  230 lbs - 50.6 = 179.4 lbs of lean body weight      His goal is to reduce the percent body fat to 18%, while retaining his current lean body weight\n When he achieves the goal of 18% body fat, his current lean body weight will then represent 82% of his total body weight Therefore, take the current lean body weight of 179.4 pounds and divide it by the goal percent of lean body weight, 82%  100% - 18% (goal body fat) = 82% (goal LBW) 179.4 (current LBW) / 0.82 (goal LBW) = 218 lbs (goal weight)      This reveals his goal body weight of 218.8 pounds, an overall weight loss of 11.2 pounds of fat from his current weight\n 230 lbs x 0.22 = 50.6 lbs of fat weight 230 lbs - 50.6 = 179.4 lbs of lean body weight 179.4 / 0.82 (goal % LBW) = 218.8 lbs (goal weight)      ",

<p>Section one will review the six essential nutrients necessary for optimal health, fitness and performance. These include carbohydrates, fats, protein, vitamins, minerals, and water.</p>
<h2 id="carbohydrates-including-dietary-fiber">Carbohydrates Including Dietary Fiber<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#carbohydrates-including-dietary-fiber">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> serve as a primary source of energy for the body and the skeletal muscles.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates are categorized as either simple sugars or complex carbohydrates.</p>
<h3 id="simple-sugars">Simple Sugars<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#simple-sugars">#</a></h3>
<p><em>Simple sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monosaccharides:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glucose</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fructose</strong> (also known as <em>fruit sugar</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Galactose</strong> (a monosaccharide that is less sweet than glucose and fructose)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod3/SimpleSugars.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Disaccharides</strong>
<ul>
<li>Formed when <strong>two monosaccharides are joined together</strong></li>
<li>Common examples of disaccharides include:
<ul>
<li>A glucose plus a fructose which makes <strong>sucrose</strong> (also known as <em>table sugar</em>)
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod3/Sucrose.png"/> 
</figure>
</li>
<li>A glucose plus a galactose which makes <strong>lactose</strong> (also known as <em>milk sugar</em>)
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod3/Lactose.png"/> 
</figure>
</li>
<li>A glucose plus a glucose which makes <strong>maltose</strong> (also known as <em>malt sugar</em>)

</ul>
<h3 id="complex-carbohydrates">Complex Carbohydrates<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#complex-carbohydrates">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Complex Carbohydrates</strong> (or <strong>Polysaccharides</strong>) is a long chain of monosaccharides.</p>
<p>Complex carbohydrates include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Starch</strong>
<ul>
<li>found in plant-based foods such as grains, potatoes, vegetables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Glycogen</strong>
<ul>
<li>found in meats</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Starch and glycogen are the only two polysaccharides that humans can fully digest</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The starch and glycogen in the foods we eat is digested into <strong>glucose</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Glucose is either <strong>used for energy</strong> or <strong>stored for future use</strong></li>
<li><em>Extra glucose is stored in the form of glycogen in the skeletal muscle and liver</em></li>
<li>The stored glycogen is used to produce energy during exercise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Carbohydrates are a preferred source of energy for the body, providing approximately 4 calories per gram of carbohydrate</strong></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range for adults ages 19 years and older indicates that <strong>45% to 65% of daily calories</strong> should be obtained from carbohydrates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best food sources are those that contain complex carbohydrates and are nutrient dense, such as vegetables and whole grains as well as fruits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dietary-fiber">Dietary Fiber<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dietary-fiber">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Dietary fiber</strong> is the <em>non-digestible form of carbohydrates</em> found in beans and peas, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and nuts.</p>
<p>Fiber is classified as either <em>soluble</em> or <em>insoluble</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Soluble Fiber</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>include those found in oats, legumes, apples, citrus fruits, strawberries, and carrots</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insoluble Fiber</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>found in whole wheat, bran, and vegetables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fiber found in the foods we eat may help to reduce the risk of several chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Adequate Intake for dietary fiber is <strong>14 grams for every 1,000 calories, or 25 grams/day for middle-age women and 38 grams/day for middle age men</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="protein">Protein<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#protein">#</a></h2>
<p>The primary function of protein is to build and repair tissues and other structures within the body.</p>
<p><strong>Amino Acids</strong> are the structural components or &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo; of protein. There are approximately <strong>20 amino acids</strong> used by the body to construct various proteins:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Essential Amino Acids</strong>
<ul>
<li>approximately 8 to 10 that must be consumed</li>
<li>in other words, <em>it is essential to eat these amino acids</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nonessential Amino Acids</strong>
<ul>
<li>the remaining <em>10</em> are considered to be nonessential since <em>the body is able to synthesize these amino acids</em> by using nitrogen and components of carbohydrate and fat molecules</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="complete--incomplete-proteins">Complete &amp; Incomplete Proteins<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#complete--incomplete-proteins">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Complete Proteins</strong> are foods that <em>contain all of the essential amino acids</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal-based sources of protein such as lean meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy products are generally complete proteins.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incomplete Proteins</strong> are foods that are <em>lacking one or more of the essential amino acids</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When combined, incomplete proteins may complement each other to provide all of the essential amino acids.</li>
<li>These incomplete protein combinations are referred to as <strong>complementary proteins</strong>.
<ul>
<li>For example, peanut butter and whole wheat bread, or brown rice and black beans.</li>
<li>A variety of plant-based, complementary proteins consumed over the course of a day can provide all of the essential amino acids.</li>
<li>These complementary proteins do not need to be consumed at the same time to provide the essential building blocks for protein.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="protein-intakes">Protein Intakes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#protein-intakes">#</a></h3>
<p>Like carbohydrates, protein <strong>provides approximately 4 calories per gram</strong>.</p>
<p><em>However, although protein may serve as a source of energy, the majority of energy needs are typically satisfied through adequate intake and availability of carbohydrates and fats</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range for protein among adults ages 19 years and older is <strong>10% to 35% of their daily calories</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lean sources of meat and poultry should be selected to decrease intake of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, a Recommended Dietary Allowance for protein has been established as <strong>0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, active individuals and athletes are likely to have greater protein needs to facilitate repair and building of lean tissue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Endurance-Trained Athletes consume 1.2 to 1.4 g/kg/day</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strength-Trained Athletes should consume 1.2 up to 1.7 g/kg/day</strong></li>
<li>Example:
<ul>
<li>The protein intake range for a 175 pound (79.5 kg) male triathlete is calculated as follows:
<ul>
<li>79.5 kg x 1.2 g/kg/day = ~95 grams of protein
<ul>
<li>this is the <em>lower limit</em> for this athlete&rsquo;s daily protein intake</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>79.5 kg x 1.4 g/kg/day = ~111 grams of protein
<ul>
<li>this is the <em>upper limit</em> for this athlete&rsquo;s daily protein intake</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recommended intake for this endurance-trained athlete is 95 to 111 grams of protein per day</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2 id="fats">Fats<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fats">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Fat</strong> is an important macronutrient serving many functions including energy production, temperature regulation, cell structure, nerve transmission, vitamin absorption, and hormone production.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, too much dietary fat also increases the risk of many chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.</li>
<li>The majority of dietary fats and fats stored within the body are in the form of <strong>triglycerides</strong>, which consist of <strong>three fatty acids</strong> attached to a <em>glycerol molecule</em>.</li>
<li>Fatty acids are either <strong>saturated</strong> or <strong>unsaturated</strong> in nature <em>based on the presence or absence of carbon-carbon double bonds and the corresponding number of hydrogen atoms</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="saturated-fats">Saturated Fats<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#saturated-fats">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Saturated fats</strong> <em>do not contain any carbon-to-carbon double bonds</em> and are therefore <em>&ldquo;saturated&rdquo; with hydrogens</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saturated fats are typically solid at room temperature such as those found in animal-based foods such as red meat and full-fat dairy products, but are also found in tropical oils such as coconut and palm.</li>
<li><em>A high consumption of saturated fat is associated with increased levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the “bad” cholesterol.</em></li>
<li><em>Subsequently, high saturated fat intake has also been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unsaturated-fats">Unsaturated Fats<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#unsaturated-fats">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Unsaturated fats</strong> contain <em>one or more carbon-to-carbon double bonds</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Monounsaturated fat</strong> contains <em>just one of these double bonds</em>; whereas, a</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Polyunsaturated fat</strong> contains <em>two or more double bonds</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unsaturated fats are typically liquid at room temperature and are found in plant-based foods such as olive, corn, soybean, canola, peanut, and safflower oils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unsaturated fats are often considered ‘healthy oils' since they help to decrease total serum cholesterol, decrease the bad LDL cholesterol, and increase the good high density lipoprotein, HDL cholesterol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Essential fatty acids</strong> are <strong>polyunsaturated fats</strong> that must be consumed in the diet such as <strong>omega-3</strong> and <strong>omega-6</strong> fatty acids.</p>
<ul>
<li>Omega-3 fatty acids are found in cold water fish and shellfish.</li>
<li>Like other polyunsaturated fats, Omega-3 and Omega 6- fatty acids provide health benefits such as improved immune system function and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fat-intake">Fat Intake<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fat-intake">#</a></h3>
<p>Fat is the most energy-dense macronutrient, <strong>providing approximately 9 calories per gram</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range for fat among adults ages 19 years and older is <strong>20% to 35% of their daily calories</strong>.</li>
<li>This corresponds to a fat intake range of approximately <strong>45 to 78 grams of fat per day</strong> for the reference 2,000 calorie intake diet pattern.</li>
<li>It is also recommended that consumption of <em>saturated fatty acids should be limited to less than 10% of daily calories</em>.</li>
<li>Most individuals will benefit from a small shift from foods that are high in saturated fat to foods rich in monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trans-fats">Trans Fats<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#trans-fats">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Trans fatty acids</strong> are another type of fat which are found naturally in some foods from ruminant animals such as cattle and lamb.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trans fats are also <strong>produced during the hydrogenation process used by food manufacturers</strong> to convert vegetable oils into semi-solid fats having a longer shelf-life.</li>
<li>Sources of trans fatty acids may include commercially prepared baked goods, fried foods, margarine, and snack foods.</li>
<li>A number of research studies have demonstrated an association between trans fatty acid intake and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.</li>
<li>Therefore, Americans are encouraged to keep their <strong>intake of trans fatty acids &ldquo;as low as possible.&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vitamins">Vitamins<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vitamins">#</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the three macronutrients, vitamins and minerals represent two additional essential nutrient groups.</p>
<p><strong>Vitamins</strong> are <em>organic, carbon-based micronutrients</em> essential for the maintenance of normal physiological processes and health.</p>
<p>There are <strong>13 different vitamins</strong> essential to the human body, most of which can only be obtained through the foods we eat.</p>
<p>Vitamins are classified into the <em>water-soluble</em> and <em>fat-soluble</em> vitamins:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water-Soluble Vitamins</strong>
<ul>
<li>Include the B-complex vitamins, vitamin C, and choline</li>
<li><em>With the exception of vitamins B6 and B12, water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body and are readily excreted in urine.</em></li>
<li>This decreases the risk of toxicity from overconsumption, but also increases the need for regular intake.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fat-Soluble Vitamins</strong>
<ul>
<li>Include vitamins A, D, E, and K</li>
<li><em>Fat-soluble vitamins are often found in fat-containing foods and stored in the liver or adipose (fat) tissue for extended periods of time.</em></li>
<li>The storage increases the risk of toxicity from overconsumption, but decreases the risk of deficiency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each vitamin has unique functions within the body, may be found in a variety of foods, and must be consumed at a specific quantity to meet the body&rsquo;s needs.</p>

<h3 id="vitamin-d">Vitamin D<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vitamin-d">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Vitamin D</strong> is a unique nutrient in that it is produced by the body through sunlight on the skin.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, in the U.S., particularly in more northern locations, most vitamin D is obtained from dietary sources such as fortified foods including milk and yogurt.</li>
<li>Adequate vitamin D is <strong>necessary for skeletal health</strong>.</li>
<li>Although vitamin D has been the topic of much scientific research over the recent years, evidence is inconclusive with regard to the many non-skeletal health benefits suggested to arise from increased vitamin D intake.</li>
<li>Although the average dietary intake of vitamin D is estimated to be less than the recommended level, the majority of the U.S. population is meeting their requirements for vitamin D through a combination of dietary sources and sunlight exposure.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, most Americans are likely to benefit from modest increases to vitamin D intake.</li>
<li>The RDA for vitamin D is as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>15 µg/day (600 IU/day) for youth and most adults</strong></li>
<li><strong>20 µg/day (800 IU/day) for adults over 71 years</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minerals">Minerals<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#minerals">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Minerals</strong> are <em>inorganic micronutrients</em> essential for the maintenance of a variety of structures and functions throughout the body.</p>
<ul>
<li>The dietary minerals are important components of the bones, teeth, muscles, blood, and nerve cells.</li>
<li>Minerals can be found in a variety of foods such as dairy products, meat, cereal and whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and nuts.</li>
<li>Dietary minerals are needed to <strong>work in conjunction with vitamins</strong> to ensure good nutrition and optimal health.</li>
</ul>
<p>Minerals are classified as either <em>major minerals</em> or <em>trace minerals</em> based on the recommended intake amounts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major Minerals</strong> (also called <strong>Macro Elements</strong>)
<ul>
<li>Include calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium</li>
<li><em>major minerals needed in large amounts</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Trace Minerals</strong> (also call <strong>Micro Elements</strong>)
<ul>
<li>include chromium, copper, fluoride, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc</li>
<li><em>trace minerals in small amounts</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each mineral has a unique function within the body, may be found in a variety of foods, and must be consumed at a specific quantity to meet the body&rsquo;s needs.</p>

<p><em>A comprehensive review of the mineral-specific functions, food sources, and recommended intake levels is beyond the scope of this module. We encourage you to refer to up-to-date credible sources such as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, for detailed information regarding specific dietary minerals.</em></p>
<h3 id="calcium">Calcium<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#calcium">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Calcium</strong> is a <strong>macromineral</strong> responsible for functions such as nerve transmission, skeletal muscle contraction, vasoconstriction and vasodilation of blood vessels, and heart rhythm.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, adequate intake of calcium is critical for optimal <strong>skeletal health</strong>.</li>
<li>A significant proportion of the U.S. population is at risk for osteoporosis due to low bone density.</li>
<li>Low calcium intake is of particular concern among youth ages 9 and older, adolescent girls, adult women, as well as all adults over the age of 51.</li>
<li>The Recommended Dietary Allowance for adults is <strong>1,000 to 1,200 mg/day</strong> depending on age and gender.</li>
<li>All age groups are encouraged to meet their RDA for calcium by increasing consumption of fat-free or low-fat dairy products and/or alternative calcium sources (e.g., calcium-fortified orange juice, dark green vegetables, whole almonds).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sodium">Sodium<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sodium">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Sodium</strong> is an essential <strong>macromineral</strong> needed by the body for fluid balance, acid-base balance, contraction of the heart, and conduction of nerve impulses.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>However, excessive sodium intake causes a proportional increase in blood pressure and subsequent risk for the development of hypertension.</em></li>
<li>Nearly all Americans are estimated to <strong>over-consume sodium with the average estimated intake of 3,400 mg per day</strong> among those 2 years and older.</li>
<li>Although a small proportion of the sodium consumed by Americans comes from salt added to foods at the table or during preparation, <strong>most sodium comes from processed foods</strong> such as yeast breads, chicken mixed dishes, pizza, pasta dishes, and luncheon meats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Americans should strive to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce daily sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg/day</strong> and further</li>
<li><strong>Reduce intake to 1,500 mg/day among persons who are 51 and older</strong> and those of any age who are African American or have hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="potassium">Potassium<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#potassium">#</a></h3>
<p>Whereas dietary intake of sodium is known to be excessively high in the American diet, intake of <strong>potassium</strong> is generally low.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dietary potassium can <strong>counteract the negative effects of sodium on blood pressure</strong>.</li>
<li>In light of the health benefits of adequate dietary potassium, many would benefit from increased consumption of potassium-rich foods such as baked potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, prunes, oranges, and bananas.</li>
<li>The Adequate Intake level for potassium for adults is <strong>4,700 mg per day</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dietary-reference-intakes">Dietary Reference Intakes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dietary-reference-intakes">#</a></h2>
<p>In 1995, the United States (the Institute of Medicine) and Canada (the Office of Nutrition Policy and Promotion of Health Canada) began collaboration to establish a uniform set of nutrient-based <strong>Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The purpose of the DRIs is to identify the nutrient intake levels that will promote health, prevent or delay diet-related chronic disease, and avoidance of nutrient overconsumption.</strong></li>
<li>The DRIs create the scientific basis for public policy such as nutritional labeling, fortification of foods, and menu-planning for school meal programs.</li>
<li>In addition, the DRIs were used in the creation of <strong>The Dietary Guidelines for Americans</strong>, the <strong>Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Patterns</strong>, and the <strong>MyPlate</strong> graphic.</li>
<li>The DRIs include <strong>four nutrient reference values</strong> to be used for assessing and planning the dietary needs of individuals and groups. These values include:
<ol>
<li><em>Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)</em></li>
<li><em>Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)</em></li>

<p>Section two will overview the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are published jointly by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<h2 id="the-guidelines">The Guidelines<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-guidelines">#</a></h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have jointly published the Dietary Guidelines for Americans every five years since 1980. Although the early editions were published voluntarily, federal law was passed in 1990 requiring the DGA to be reviewed, updated, and republished every five years. Although many of the DGA recommendations have remained relatively consistent over time, the Dietary Guidelines have evolved as research has grown and scientific knowledge has advanced. The first several editions of the DGA were relatively simple consumer-oriented brochures. However, in recent years the DGA have expanded and shifted toward more specific recommendations supported by an extensive evidence-based review process conducted by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod3/DGA.png"/> 
</figure>

<p><strong>The main purpose of the Dietary Guidelines is to inform the development of Federal food, nutrition, and health policies and programs.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is written for policymakers, as well as nutrition, exercise, and health professionals, not the general public.</li>
<li>The Dietary Guidelines is a critical tool for professionals to help Americans make healthy choices in their daily lives to help prevent chronic disease and enjoy a healthy diet.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s recommendations are ultimately intended to help individuals improve and maintain overall health and reduce the risk of chronic disease - its focus is disease prevention.</li>
<li>The Dietary Guidelines is not intended to be used to treat disease.</li>
<li>Regardless of an individual&rsquo;s current health status, almost all people in the United States could benefit from shifting choices to better support healthy eating patterns.</li>
<li>Thus, the Dietary Guidelines may be used by fitness professionals to encourage healthy eating patterns for clients, club members, and class participants.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The current 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines were released on January 7th, 2016.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> is designed for professionals to help all individuals ages 2 years and older and their families to <strong>consume a healthy, nutritionally adequate diet</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A focus of the recommendations in the <em>2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em> is on <strong>healthy eating patterns</strong> and their food and nutrient characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines</em> provides five overarching Guidelines that encourage healthy eating patterns, recognize that individuals will need to make shifts in their food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy pattern, and acknowledge that all segments of our society have a role to play in supporting healthy choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These Guidelines also embody the idea that a healthy eating pattern is not a rigid prescription, but rather, an adaptable framework in which individuals can enjoy foods that meet their personal, cultural, and traditional preferences and fit within their budget.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Five Overarching Guidelines include:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>(Covered in Chapter 1 of the DGA Policy Document)</li>
<li>All food and beverage choices matter</li>
<li>Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, support nutrient adequacy, and reduce the risk of chronic disease</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Focus on variety, nutrient density, and amount</strong></li>
</ol>

<li><strong>Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>(Covered in Chapter 1 of the DGA Policy Document)</li>

<h2 id="key-recommendations">Key Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-recommendations">#</a></h2>
<p>Key Recommendations provide further guidance on how individuals can follow the five Guidelines.</p>
<p><em>The first Key Recommendation is to consume a healthy eating pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level.</em></p>
<h3 id="healthy-eating-pattern">Healthy Eating Pattern<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#healthy-eating-pattern">#</a></h3>
<p>A healthy eating pattern includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Variety of vegetables from all of the subgroups</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Healthy eating patterns include a variety of vegetables from all five vegetable subgroups including dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy, and other.</li>
<li>Include all fresh, frozen, canned and dried options in cooked or raw forms, including vegetable juices.</li>
<li>Vegetables should be consumed in a nutrient-dense form, with limited additions such as salt, butter, or creamy sauces.</li>
<li>The recommended amount of vegetables in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 2½ cup-equivalents per day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fruits, especially whole fruits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Include fresh, canned, dried, or frozen fruits</li>
<li>The recommended amount of fruits in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 2 cup-equivalents per day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grains, at least half of which are whole grains</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The recommended amount of grains in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 6 ounce-equivalents per day.</li>
<li>When refined grains are chosen, they should be enriched.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or fortified soy beverages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk or yogurt and decreasing the proportion that is cheese would decrease saturated fats and sodium and increase potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin D provided from the dairy group.</li>
<li>The recommended amount of dairy in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is based on age rather than calorie level.</li>
<li>For adolescents ages 9 to 18 years and for adults, the recommendation is 3 cup-equivalents per day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts, seeds, and soy products</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The recommendation for protein foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 5½ ounce-equivalents per day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oils</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Including: canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils.</li>
<li>Oils also are naturally present in nuts, seeds, seafood, olives, and avocados.</li>
<li>Oils are fats that contain a high percentage of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are liquid a room temperature.</li>
<li>Although they are not a food group, oils are emphasized as part of healthy eating patterns because they are a major source of essential fatty acids and vitamin E.</li>
<li>The recommendation for oils in the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern at the 2,000-calorie level is 27 grams (about 5 teaspoons) per day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A healthy eating pattern limits: Saturated fats and trans fats, added sugars, and sodium.</em></p>
<h3 id="quantitative">Quantitative<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#quantitative">#</a></h3>
<p>Key Recommendations that are quantitative are provided for several components of the diet that should be limited.</p>
<p>These components are of particular public health concern in the United States, and the specified limits can help individuals achieve healthy eating patterns within calorie limits.</p>
<p>These quantified key recommendations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consume less than 10 percent of calories per day from added sugars</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The added sugars recommendation is a target based on food pattern modeling and national data on intakes of calories from added sugars.</li>
<li>This target demonstrates the public health need to limit calories from added sugars to meet food group and nutrient needs within calorie limits.</li>
<li>When added sugars exceed 10% of calories, a healthy eating pattern may be difficult to achieve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consume less than 10 percent of calories per day from saturated fats</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The recommendation to consume less than 10 percent of calories per day as saturated fats is a target based on evidence that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.</li>
<li>However, replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates is not associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.</li>
<li>Individuals should limit intake of trans fats to as low as possible by limiting foods that contain synthetic sources of trans fats, such as partially hydrogenated oils, and by limiting other solid fats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consume less than 2,300 milligrams per day of sodium</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Americans are encouraged to follow the age- and sex-appropriate Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for sodium set by the Institute of Medicine.</li>
<li>The UL is 2,300 milligrams per day for individuals ages 14 years and older.</li>
<li>The recommendations for children younger than 14 years of age are the age- and sex-appropriate Upper Limits, which vary from 1,500 to 2,200, depending on age.</li>
<li>For adults with hypertension or prehypertension, further reduction to 1,500 mg per day can result in greater blood pressure reduction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If alcohol is consumed, it should be consumed in moderation,</strong> defined as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol should only be consumed by adults of legal drinking age.</li>
<li>It is not recommended that individuals begin drinking or drink more for any reason, and there are many circumstances in which individuals should not drink, such as during pregnancy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="eating-patterns">Eating Patterns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#eating-patterns">#</a></h2>
<p>A focus of the recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans is on healthy eating patterns and their food and nutrient characteristics.</p>
<p><em>An eating pattern represents the combination of foods and beverages that constitute an individual&rsquo;s complete dietary intake over time.</em></p>
<p>Throughout the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines, the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern is used to illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food groups and other dietary components that make up healthy eating patterns.</p>
<p>Other examples of healthy eating patterns include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern</li>
<li>Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern</li>
<li>Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Eating Plan</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em> reflects for the first time a robust body of scientific evidence on overall eating patterns and chronic disease.</p>
<p>Healthy eating patterns support a healthy body weight and can help prevent and reduce the risk of chronic disease throughout periods of growth, development, and aging as well as during pregnancy.</p>
<p><em>The following principles of healthy eating patterns apply to meeting the Key Recommendations:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>An eating pattern represents the totality of all foods and beverages consumed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All foods consumed as part of a healthy eating pattern fit together like a puzzle to meet nutritional needs without exceeding limits, such as those for saturated fats, added sugars, sodium, and total calories.</li>
<li>All forms of foods, including fresh, canned, dried, and frozen, can be included in healthy eating patterns.</li>
<li>Eating patterns are more than the sum of their parts and may be more predictive of overall health and disease risk than individual foods or nutrients.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals should aim to meet their nutrient needs through healthy eating patterns that include nutrient-dense foods.</li>
<li>Foods in nutrient-dense forms contain essential vitamins and minerals and also dietary fiber and other naturally occurring substances that may have positive health effects.</li>
<li>In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements may be useful in providing one or more nutrients that otherwise may be consumed in less than recommended amounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Healthy eating patterns are adaptable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals have more than one way to achieve a healthy eating pattern.</li>
<li>Any eating pattern can be tailored to the individual&rsquo;s socio-cultural and personal preferences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shifting-toward-healthy-eating-patterns">Shifting Toward Healthy Eating Patterns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#shifting-toward-healthy-eating-patterns">#</a></h3>
<p>Chapter 2 of the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans policy document focuses on current food intakes among Americans and the shifts needed for Americans to align with healthy eating patterns. As such, chapter 2 focuses on the fourth Dietary Guideline: Shift to healthier food and beverage choices.</p>
<p>Making changes to eating patterns can be overwhelming. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that every food choice is an opportunity to move toward a healthy eating pattern. Small shifts in food and beverage choices over the course of a week, a day, or even a meal can make a big difference.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of realistic shift strategies that can help people adopt healthy eating patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shift from High Calorie Snacks to Nutrient-Dense Snacks</li>
<li>Shift from Fruit Products with Added Sugars to Whole Fruit</li>
<li>Shift from Refined Grains to Whole Grains</li>
<li>Shift from Snacks with Added Sugars and Salt to Unsalted Snacks</li>
<li>Shift from Solid Fats to Healthy Oils</li>
<li>Shift from Beverages with Added Sugars to No-Sugar Added Beverages</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="support-healthy-eating-patterns-for-all">Support Healthy Eating Patterns for All<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#support-healthy-eating-patterns-for-all">#</a></h3>
<p>Collective action is needed to create a new paradigm in which healthy lifestyle choices at home, school, work, and in the community are easy, accessible, affordable, and normative.</p>
<p>Everyone has a role in helping individuals shift their everyday food, beverage, and physical activity choices to align with the Dietary Guidelines.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 of the Dietary Guidelines policy document focuses on the fifth Guideline: Support healthy eating patterns for all.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod3/EatingPatterns.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>As shown in the Social-Ecological Model, a multitude of choices, messages, individual resources, and other factors affect the food and physical activity choices an individual makes, and these decisions are rarely made in isolation.</p>
<p>The scientific literature has described a number of specific circumstances that can limit an individual&rsquo;s or family&rsquo;s capacity to choose a healthy diet.</p>
<p>These contextual factors - food access, household food insecurity, and acculturation - are particularly important for millions of individuals living in the United States.</p>
<p>As appropriate, fitness professionals can consider these critical factors when developing strategies and providing education to enhance the adoption of healthy eating patterns and regular physical activity.</p>
<p><em><strong>To shift from current eating patterns to those that align with the Dietary Guidelines, collective action across all segments of society is needed.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>These actions must involve a broad range of sectors, occur across a variety of settings, and address the needs of individuals, families, and communities.</em></p>
<p>These actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>identifying and addressing successful approaches for change</li>
<li>improving knowledge of what constitutes healthy eating and physical activity patterns</li>
<li>enhancing access to adequate amounts of healthy, safe, and affordable food choices</li>
<li>and promoting change in social and cultural norms and values to embrace, support, and maintain healthy eating and physical activity behaviors</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-plate">My Plate<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#my-plate">#</a></h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a long history of producing food guidance graphics intended to support healthy dietary choices.</p>
<p>From the Basic Seven Guide to Good Eating of the 1940s, to the Basic Four Daily Food Guide of the 1950s and 60s, the Hassle-Free Daily Food Guide of the 70s, followed by the original Food Guide Pyramid of the early 90s, and then the MyPyramid: Steps to a Healthier You launched in 2005.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod3/Graphics.png"/> 
</figure>

<p><strong>The current food guidance graphic is known as MyPlate, which was introduced in 2011.</strong></p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod3/MyPlate.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The MyPlate graphic was launched as part of a larger communications initiative based on the 2010 edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MyPlate is still used today in support of the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans to help consumers make better food choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MyPlate graphic was developed as the result of consumer research during which most focus groups favored the visual of a simple and familiar mealtime place setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MyPlate illustrates five food groups on a placemat that is suggestive of proportions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>fruits</strong></li>
<li><strong>vegetables</strong></li>
<li><strong>grains</strong></li>
<li><strong>protein</strong></li>
<li><strong>dairy</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>“My” continues the personalization approach from the previous MyPyramid icon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integral to the MyPlate design is the incorporation of the <em>ChooseMyPlate.gov</em> website address where consumers can take advantage of additional resources and apply the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in a personal way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>simplicity</li>
<li>the visual representation of food group proportionality</li>
<li>the emphasis on the need to consume from all food groups</li>
<li>it conveys the message to make half your plate fruits and vegetables</li>
<li>and the flexibility to tailor meals to different diets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>difficulty applying MyPlate to mixed dishes such as lasagna or fajitas</li>
<li>the graphic does not convey the best food choices within each group</li>
<li>it may be more applicable to dinner than to breakfast, lunch, or snacks</li>
<li>the graphic does not represent the total day or eating pattern</li>
<li>and although it conveys proportionality, it does not represent amount or serving sizes</li>

<h1 id="section-3-nutrition-facts-labels">Section 3: Nutrition Facts Labels<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-3-nutrition-facts-labels">#</a></h1>
<p>Section three will review the current Nutrition Facts label and introduce the new label recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, which went into effect in May 1994, mandated that all pre-packaged foods display a nutrition label, with the exception of foods intended for immediate consumption, such as fresh produce.</li>
<li>Presently, the Food and Drug Administration regulates the labeling on all packaged foods, as well as health claims and nutrient content claims.</li>
<li>The current regulations require the Nutrition Facts label to include information on serving size, number of servings, total calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sugar, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and trans fat.</li>
<li>Information regarding additional nutrients may be included on a voluntary basis.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interpretation-of-a-nutrition-facts-label">Interpretation of a Nutrition Facts Label<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#interpretation-of-a-nutrition-facts-label">#</a></h2>
<p>This section provides a sample Nutrition Facts label for educational purposes.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod3/NutritionFacts.png"/> 
</figure>

<h3 id="serving-size">Serving Size<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#serving-size">#</a></h3>
<p>We will begin our review of the label by looking at the serving size and the number of servings in the package.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, the serving size is 1 cup and the entire package contains 2 servings (i.e., 2 cups).</li>
<li>Generally speaking, serving sizes are standardized to make it easier to compare similar foods.</li>
<li>Serving sizes for like foods are provided in similar units, such as cups, fluid ounces, or pieces, followed by the metric amount such as grams or milliliters.</li>
<li><strong>The size of the serving on the food package influences the number of calories and all the nutrient amounts listed on the top part of the label.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to the serving size, especially how many servings there are in the food package.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Then ask yourself, &ldquo;How many servings am I actually consuming&rdquo;?</strong></li>
<li>In the sample label, one serving equals one cup.</li>
<li>If you ate the whole package, you would eat two cups.</li>
<li>That doubles the calories and other nutrient numbers, including the % Daily Values as shown in the sample label.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="calories-and-calories-from-fat">Calories and Calories from Fat<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#calories-and-calories-from-fat">#</a></h3>
<p>Next, check the calories and the calories from fat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calories provide a measure of how much energy you get from a serving of this food.</li>
<li>Many Americans consume more calories than they need without meeting recommended intakes for a number of nutrients.</li>
<li><em>The calorie section of the label can help consumers manage their weight.</em></li>
<li><strong>Remember, the number of servings consumed determines the number of calories actually consumed.</strong></li>
<li>In the example, there are 250 calories in one serving.</li>
<li>110 of the total calories are derived from fat, which means almost half the calories in a single serving come from fat.</li>
<li>So, if you eat the entire contents of the package, then you would consume two servings, or 500 calories, and 220 of those calories would come from fat.</li>
<li><strong>As a general guide to calories per serving, 40 Calories is low, 100 Calories is moderate, and 400 Calories or more is high.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This general guide to Calories provides a general reference for calories when you look at a Nutrition Facts label.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This guide is based on a 2,000 calorie diet.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adequate-nutrient-amounts">Adequate Nutrient Amounts<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#adequate-nutrient-amounts">#</a></h3>
<p>The nutrients listed in the yellow section are those that Americans generally eat in adequate amounts, or even too much.</p>

<li>Eating too much fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium may increase the risk of certain chronic diseases, like heart disease, some cancers, or high blood pressure.</li>
<li>Therefore, these nutrients should be limited in a healthy eating pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Americans don&rsquo;t consume enough dietary fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron in their diets.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are identified in blue as &ldquo;get enough of these nutrients.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Eating enough of these nutrients can improve your health and help reduce the risk of some diseases and conditions.</li>
<li>For example, getting enough calcium may reduce the risk of osteoporosis, a condition that results in brittle bones as one ages.</li>
<li>Eating a diet high in dietary fiber promotes healthy bowel function.</li>
<li>Additionally, a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain dietary fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Remember, the Nutrition Facts label should be used not only to help limit those nutrients you want to cut back on, but also to increase those nutrients you need to consume in greater amounts.</em></p>
<h3 id="footnote">Footnote<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#footnote">#</a></h3>
<p>The footnote in the lower part of the nutrition label informs consumers that the “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.”</p>
<ul>
<li>This statement must be on all food labels.</li>
<li>But the remaining information in the full footnote may not be on the package if the size of the label is too small.</li>
<li>When the full footnote does appear, it will always be the same.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t change from product to product, because it shows recommended dietary advice for all Americans&ndash;it is not about a specific food product.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="daily-values">Daily Values<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#daily-values">#</a></h4>
<p>Look at the amounts in the footnote&ndash;these are the Daily Values (DV) for each nutrient listed and are based on public health experts' advice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily values are recommended levels of intakes.</li>
<li>Daily values in the footnote are based on a 2,000 or 2,500 calorie diet.</li>
<li>Note how the DVs for some nutrients change, while others, like cholesterol and sodium, remain the same for both calorie amounts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="percent-daily-value">Percent Daily Value<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#percent-daily-value">#</a></h3>
<p>The column shaded in purple on the right of the label represents the Percent Daily Value for the corresponding nutrients.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a general guide, 5% of the Daily Value or less is low for all nutrients, those you want to limit, such as fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium, or for those that you want to consume in greater amounts, such as dietary fiber and calcium. 20% of the Daily Value or more is high for all nutrients.</li>
<li>For example, for a 2,000 calorie diet, the daily value for total fat is 65 grams.
<ul>
<li>This particular food product contains 12 grams of total fat per serving.</li>
<li>12 is 18% of 65, so the % daily value for total fat is 18% in one serving.</li>
<li>If the entire container, in other words 2 servings, is actually consumed, then the % daily value is doubled to 36%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Percent Daily Value for a specific food should not be confused with the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range for daily fat, carbohydrates, and protein intake.</li>
<li>In other words, the 18% Daily Value for total fat in this food does not mean that 18% of the total calories are derived from fat.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="macronutrient-calculation">Macronutrient Calculation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#macronutrient-calculation">#</a></h3>
<p>This section will review macronutrient calculations to determine the percent of fat, carbohydrate, and protein calories that are derived from the total calories in one serving.</p>
<p><em>To calculate the % of total calories represented by fat, carbohydrates, and protein, multiply the total grams for each macronutrient by the corresponding caloric value.</em></p>
<h4 id="fat-calculation">Fat Calculation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fat-calculation">#</a></h4>
<p>As reported on the Nutrition Facts label, this food product contains 12 grams of total fat.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Recall that the caloric value of fat is 9 calories per gram.</em></li>
<li>So, 12 grams of fat times 9 calories per gram equals 108 calories from fat.</li>
<li>108 fat calories divided by 250 total calories per serving equals 43% fat.</li>
<li>So, 43% of the total calories are derived from fat.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="carbohydrate-calculation">Carbohydrate Calculation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#carbohydrate-calculation">#</a></h4>
<p>This food product contains 31 grams of carbohydrates and <em>each gram of carbohydrate provides 4 calories of energy</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, 31 grams of carbohydrates multiplied by 4 calories per gram equals 124 calories from carbohydrates.</li>
<li>124 carbohydrate calories divided by 250 total calories per serving equals 49% carbohydrates.</li>
<li>49% of the total calories are derived from carbohydrates.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="protein-calculation">Protein Calculation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#protein-calculation">#</a></h4>
<p>Finally, there are 5 grams of protein per serving and <em>protein provides 4 calories per gram</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>5 grams of protein times 4 calories per gram equals 20 calories from protein, divided by 250 total calories equals 8% of the total calories are derived from protein.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Add these macronutrient percentages together and we have accounted for 100% of the total calories per serving.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Remember, the AMDR for fat is 20% to 35% of the daily calories.</em></li>
<li>Relative to this range, at 43%, the proportion of fat in one serving of this food exceeds this upper limit of this recommended range.</li>
<li>Even though one serving represents 18% of the Daily Value for fat, the proportion of fat per serving relative to the other macronutrients is fairly high.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sample-macronutrient-calculations">Sample Macronutrient Calculations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sample-macronutrient-calculations">#</a></h2>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s perform macronutrient calculations once again, this time in the form of a multiple choice question.</p>
<ul>
<li>An apple cinnamon breakfast bar has 3 grams of fat, 26 grams of carbohydrates, and 1 gram of protein. How many total calories in one bar and what percentage of the total calories are derived from fat?
<ul>
<li>A. 135 kcal &amp; 20% fat</li>
<li>B. 246 kcal &amp; 15% fat</li>
<li>C. 30 kcal &amp; 10% fat</li>
<li>D. 135 kcal &amp; 35% fat</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the information provided and recalling the caloric value for each macronutrient, complete the calculations to determine the number of calories derived from each macronutrient.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>3 grams of fat times 9 calories per gram equals 27 calories from fat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>26 grams of carbohydrates times 4 calories per gram equals 104 calories from carbohydrates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 gram of protein times 4 calories per gram equals 4 calories from protein.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add together the calories from each macronutrient to determine the total calories in one breakfast bar…</p>
<ul>
<li>135 total calories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, to determine the percent of calories derived from fat…</p>
<ul>
<li>27 fat calories divided by 135 total calories equals 20% fat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, the correct answer is response option A.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fat: 3g x 9cal/g = 27 calories</li>
<li>Carbohydrates: 26g x 4cal/g = 104 calories</li>
<li>Protein: 1g x 4cal/g = 4 calories</li>
<li>Total Calories = 135 = 27 cal + 104 cal + 4 cal</li>
<li>% of calories from fat = 27 / 135 = .20 or 20%</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-new-nutrition-facts-label">The New Nutrition Facts Label<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-new-nutrition-facts-label">#</a></h2>
<p>The Nutrition Facts label, introduced over 20 years ago, helps consumers make informed food choices and maintain healthy dietary practices. In May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the new Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information, including the link between diet and chronic diseases such as obesity and heart disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the compliance date for July 26, 2018, with and additional year to comply for manufacturers with annual food sales of less than $10 million. However, on June 13, 2017, the FDA announced its intention to extend the compliance date. The FDA will provide details on the extension through a Federal Register Notice at a later time. <em>Please check the fda.gov website for updates regarding compliance implementation.</em></p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod3/NewFactsLabel.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>The “iconic” look of the label will remain, but the FDA is making important updates to ensure consumers have access to the information they need to make informed decisions about the foods they eat.</li>
<li>These changes include increasing the type size for “Calories,” “servings per container,” and the “Serving size” declaration, and bolding the number of calories and the “Serving size” declaration to highlight this information.</li>
<li>Manufacturers must declare the actual amount, in addition to percent Daily Value of vitamin D, calcium, iron and potassium. They can voluntarily declare the gram amount for other vitamins and minerals.</li>
<li>The footnote is changing to better explain what percent Daily Value means. It will read: “<em>The % Daily Value tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice.</em>”</li>
<li>“Added sugars,” in grams and as percent Daily Value, will be included on the label. Scientific data shows that it is difficult to meet nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits if you consume more than 10 percent of your total daily calories from added sugar, and this is consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.</li>
<li>The list of nutrients that are required or permitted to be declared is being updated.
<ul>
<li>Vitamin D and potassium will be required on the label.</li>
<li>Calcium and iron will continue to be required.</li>
<li>Vitamins A and C will no longer be required, but can be included on a voluntary basis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While continuing to require “Total Fat,” “Saturated Fat,” and “Trans Fat” on the label, “Calories from Fat” is being removed because research shows the type of fat is more important than the amount.</li>
<li>Daily values for nutrients like sodium, dietary fiber and vitamin D are being updated based on newer scientific evidence from the Institute of Medicine and other reports such as the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report, which was used in developing the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Daily values are reference amounts of nutrients to consume or not to exceed and are used to calculate the percent Daily Value (% DV) that manufacturers include on the label. The %DV helps consumers understand the nutrition information in the context of a total daily diet.</li>
<li>By law, serving sizes must be based on amounts of foods and beverages that people are actually eating, not what they should be eating. How much people eat and drink has changed since the previous serving size requirements were published in 1993. For example, the reference amount used to set a serving of ice cream was previously ½ cup but is changing to 2/3 cup. The reference amount used to set a serving of soda is changing from 8 ounces to 12 ounces.</li>
<li>Package size affects what people eat. So for packages that are between one and two servings, such as a 20 ounce soda or a 15-ounce can of soup, the calories and other nutrients will be required to be labeled as one serving because people typically consume it in one sitting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dual-column-labels">Dual Column Labels<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dual-column-labels">#</a></h3>
<p>For certain products that are larger than a single serving, but that could be consumed in one sitting or multiple sittings, manufacturers will have to provide “dual column” labels to indicate the amount of calories and nutrients on both a “per serving” and “per package”/“per unit” basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples would be a 24-ounce bottle of soda, a pint of ice cream.</li>
<li>With dual-column labels available, people will be able to easily understand how many calories and nutrients they are getting if they eat or drink the entire package/unit at one time.</li>
<li>Dual column labels will also be used for foods in the packaged and prepared forms.</li>

<ul>
<li>obesity prevalence trends in the United States</li>
<li>the basics of metabolism and energy balance</li>
<li>the role of regular physical activity to maintain a healthy body weight</li>

<h2 id="obesity-prevalence-in-the-us">Obesity Prevalence in the U.S.<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#obesity-prevalence-in-the-us">#</a></h2>
<p>The United States faces a lifestyle health crisis. Inadequate physical activity levels and poor nutrition are driving overweight and obesity rates steadily higher, producing corresponding increases in heart disease, diabetes, and other obesity-related diseases.</p>
<h3 id="historical-obesity-trends">Historical Obesity Trends<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#historical-obesity-trends">#</a></h3>
<p>The graphic below illustrates selected historical Center for Disease Control and Prevention adult obesity prevalence maps based on data collected through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System between 1990 and 2010.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod3/ObesityHistory.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>Unlike data collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which utilizes a measured height and weight, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System calculates body mass index using self-reported height and weight.</li>
<li>Adults are known to underreport weight and over report height, which leads to BMI values biased toward lower than actual values.</li>
<li>Subsequently, the actual obesity rates based on this data may be higher than reported.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, the trends over time clearly demonstrate a rise in obesity among U.S. adults.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="current-obesity-trends">Current Obesity Trends<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#current-obesity-trends">#</a></h3>
<p>Beginning in 2011, several methodological changes were implemented with the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which are likely to have altered obesity prevalence estimates in comparison to data derived prior these changes.</p>
<p>For example, beginning with 2011, data records were excluded from obesity prevalence rates if:</p>
<ul>
<li>self-reported height was less than 3 feet or greater than or equal to 8 feet</li>
<li>self-reported weight was less than 50 pounds or greater than or equal to 650 pounds</li>
<li>calculated BMI was less than 12 kg/m2 or greater than or equal to 100 kg/m2</li>
<li>or women who reported being pregnant</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Due to these and other changes, the obesity prevalence maps from 2011 to the present year cannot be compared to those from 2010 and earlier.</em></p>
<p>The graphic below illustrates the U.S. obesity prevalence map for 2015.</p>

<p>In 2015…</p>
<ul>
<li>No state had a prevalence of obesity less than 20%</li>
<li>6 states and the District of Columbia had a prevalence of obesity between 20% and &lt;25%</li>
<li>19 states and Puerto Rico had a prevalence of obesity between 25% and &lt;30%</li>

<h2 id="metabolism-and-energy-balance">Metabolism and Energy Balance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#metabolism-and-energy-balance">#</a></h2>
<p><em>The biochemical process of breaking down macronutrients including carbohydrates, fats, and protein, to provide the energy necessary to sustain life and to support activity</em> is known as <strong>metabolism</strong>.</p>
<p>The energy utilized by the body is often measured in terms of calories.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>calorie</strong> (with a small “c”) is a unit of energy defined as <em>the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius</em>.</li>
<li>The “calories” we refer to with regard to the energy content of food and the energy expended through exercise are technically <em>kilocalories</em>.</li>
<li>A <strong>kilocalorie (kcal)</strong> or <strong>Calorie (with a large “C”)</strong> is 1,000 calories or <em>the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water 1 degree Celsius</em>.</li>
<li>In both dietetics and fitness, it is common to interchange the terms “calorie” and “kilocalorie”, although in both cases the actual unit of energy is a kilocalorie.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The total amount of energy burned throughout the course of a day</em> is known as the <strong>total daily energy expenditure</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The total daily energy expenditure is composed of various sources of both <strong>involuntary</strong> and <strong>voluntary</strong> caloric expenditure.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="//kate3SQD.github.io/prestudy/mod3/TDEE.png"/>

<h3 id="involuntary-caloric-expenditure">Involuntary Caloric Expenditure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#involuntary-caloric-expenditure">#</a></h3>
<p>Approximately <strong>60% of total daily energy expenditure</strong> represented by the <em>basal</em> and <em>resting metabolic rates</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Basal Metabolic Rate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>defined as <em>the minimum amount of energy needed to sustain basic life functions</em> such as respiration, heart rhythm, blood circulation, and brain activity, while lying at complete rest, in the morning, after sleep, and in a fasted state</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resting Metabolic Rate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>typically about 10% higher than the basal rate and represents <em>the energy expenditure in a resting and fasted state</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thermal Effect of Food (TEF)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>the energy expenditure above RMR related to the digestion, absorption, and storage of the food we eat</em></li>
<li>The thermal effect of food contributes approximately <strong>10% to 15% of the total daily energy expenditure</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The BMR, RMR, and TEF can all be considered involuntary components of daily metabolism</em></p>
<h3 id="voluntary-caloric-expenditure">Voluntary Caloric Expenditure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#voluntary-caloric-expenditure">#</a></h3>
<p>The voluntary component of total daily energy expenditure is represented by <em>activity thermogenesis, which includes energy expenditure from exercise-related activity and non-exercise activity thermogenesis</em>.</p>
<p>Exercise-related activities include both structured, intentional exercise as well as leisure time physical activity.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis</strong> (abbreviated as <strong>NEAT</strong>)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>the energy we expend during everything we do that is not sleeping, eating, structured exercise, or leisure time physical activity</em></li>
<li>NEAT includes energy expenditure associated with activities of daily living, occupational activity, fidgeting, toe-tapping, spontaneous muscular contraction, communication, transportation, and maintenance of posture</li>
<li>NEAT represents the most variable component of daily energy expenditure, ranging from 15% of TDEE in very sedentary individuals to ≥ 50% of TDEE in highly active individuals</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="energy-balance">Energy Balance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#energy-balance">#</a></h3>
<p><em>The maintenance of a healthy body weight and prevention of weight gain is dependent on managing an energy balance between energy intake and energy expenditure.</em></p>
<h4 id="energy-intake">Energy Intake<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#energy-intake">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Energy intake is the sum of all calories ingested through the food that we eat.</li>
<li>The macronutrients including carbohydrates, fat, and protein provide the vast majority of the calories in our diet.</li>
<li>Alcoholic beverages also account for some additional calories.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="energy-expenditure">Energy Expenditure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#energy-expenditure">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Majority of daily caloric expenditure</strong> is the result of our <strong>resting metabolic rate</strong> (<em>typically accounting for 60% to 75% of daily energy expenditure</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thermal effect</strong> of digesting food represents approximately <em>10% of daily energy expenditure</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remaining calories are burned through various types of physical activity such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>non-exercise activity thermogenesis, activities of daily living, transportation and occupational activity, and leisure-time physical activity and structured exercise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<h2 id="guidelines-for-safe-weight-loss">Guidelines for Safe Weight Loss<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#guidelines-for-safe-weight-loss">#</a></h2>
<p>Regular leisure-time physical activity and cardiorespiratory exercise play an important role in the maintenance of a healthy body weight and the prevention of obesity.</p>
<p>The direct positive impact of physical activity and exercise results from increased energy expenditure during and immediately after activity.</p>
<p>Depending on body size, level of fitness, and exercise intensity, adults can easily expend an extra 1,000 calories per week by exercising 30 minutes, 5 days per week.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>An increase in muscle mass as a result of resistance training contributes to the maintenance of or increase in resting metabolic rate.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Such an increase in metabolic rate may complement the increase in caloric expenditure produced by aerobic exercise training to further assist with weight control.</li>
<li>In theory, a gain of 1 kg or 2.2 lbs of muscle mass should increase resting energy expenditure by ~ 21 kcal/day.</li>
<li>Over the course of one year this is an additional ~7,665 calories or ~ 2 lbs of potential fat loss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular physical activity can reduce, but not eliminate, the mortality risk of obesity independent of weight loss or BMI.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is supported by findings from large longitudinal studies including the <em>Harvard Alumni Health Study</em>, the <em>Nurses' Health Study</em>, and the <em>Women&rsquo;s Health Study</em>.</li>
<li>In addition, studies investigating the role of physical fitness have generally observed that having higher cardiorespiratory fitness can remove the excess risk of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality associated with being overweight or obese.</li>
<li>A higher level of cardiorespiratory fitness also protects against weight gain.</li>
<li>Findings from the <em>Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study</em> demonstrate that among both men and women, each minute of improved maximal treadmill endurance time was accompanied by a proportionate reduction in weight gain over the study period and reduced the risk of a weight gain greater than 20 pounds by 21%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical activity is often cited as the best predictor of weight maintenance following weight loss; however, a significant volume of physical activity is often necessary.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-guidelines">Exercise Guidelines<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exercise-guidelines">#</a></h3>
<p>The guidelines for physical activity and exercise have been adopted from the American College of Sports Medicine.</p>
<h4 id="aerobic-exercise">Aerobic Exercise<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#aerobic-exercise">#</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Frequency:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Aerobic exercise should be performed <em>5 or more days per week</em> to maximize caloric expenditure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Intensity:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The exercise intensity should be moderate-to-vigorous depending on the health status, initial fitness level, and abilities of the participant.</li>
<li><em>Moderate-intensity exercise corresponds to 3 to 5.9 METs or 40 to 60% of HRR</em>.</li>
<li>Vigorous-intensity exercise corresponds to ≥ 6 METs or ≥ 60% of HRR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Time:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Initially, individuals should be encouraged to complete a minimum of <em>30 minutes of aerobic activity per day</em>, progressing to 60 minutes per day.</li>
<li>Evidence indicates that moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity of <em>150 to 250 minutes per week</em> with an energy expenditure equivalent to ~1,200 to 2,000 calories per week is sufficient to prevent a weight gain greater than 3% in most adults.</li>
<li>For most, physical activity greater than 250 minutes per week is necessary for clinically significant weight loss and to prevent weight gain following weight loss.</li>
<li>Most research suggests that more is better regarding the volume of physical activity needed to prevent weight regain after weight loss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Type:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The type of aerobic activity should be suitable to the abilities and preferences of the client and should include rhythmic, large muscle group activities with an emphasis on increased caloric expenditure for maintenance of a healthy body weight and achievement of other health benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="resistance-training">Resistance Training<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#resistance-training">#</a></h4>
<p>Resistance training should be considered a supplement to the combination of aerobic exercise and modest reductions in caloric intake to facilitate weight loss. As such, resistance training should be perform in addition to, but not in place of time dedicated to cardiorespiratory exercise. <em>The guidelines for resistance training for obese populations are similar to those recommended for apparently healthy adults.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Frequency:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Resistance training should be performed <em>2-3 days per week on non-consecutive days</em> separated by at least 48 hours for the same muscle group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Intensity:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>8 to 15 repetitions should be performed per set, corresponding to 60% to 80% of one-repetition maximum</em>.</li>

<h3 id="additional-recommendations">Additional Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#additional-recommendations">#</a></h3>
<p>Obese individuals are likely to have one or more comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease or orthopedic limitations. <em>Therefore, it is important to consider precautions and contraindications corresponding with these other conditions.</em></p>
<p>In addition, the American College of Sports Medicine and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics also present the following recommendations for weight loss programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Target a minimal reduction in body weight of at least 5% to 10% of initial body weight over 3-6 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strive for an energy deficit of 500 to 1,000 kcal/day to achieve a weekly weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>This reduced energy intake should be combined with a reduction in dietary fat to &lt;30% of total daily calories.</li>
<li>However, energy intake should be sufficient to meet the individual&rsquo;s resting metabolic rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Portion control should be included as part of a comprehensive weight management program.</p>
<ul>
<li>Portion control at meals and snacks results in reduced energy intake and weight loss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may be necessary to accumulate the desired volume of physical activity through multiple daily bouts of at least 10 minutes in duration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Target changing eating and exercise behaviors, as sustained changes in both behaviors result in significant long-term weight loss.</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate behavioral modification strategies to facilitate adoption and maintenance of desired changes in behavior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance communication between healthcare professionals, dieticians, and exercise professionals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="national-weight-control-registry">National Weight Control Registry<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#national-weight-control-registry">#</a></h2>
<p>The National Weight Control Registry is an ongoing study to investigate the strategies and behaviors of individuals successful at long-term maintenance of weight loss.</p>
<ul>
<li>The NWCR was established in 1994 by Dr. Rena Wing, the director of the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center at Brown University and Dr. James Hill, the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Colorado.</li>
<li>The Registry was developed in part to identify and study the characteristics and strategies of those who have experienced successful maintenance of weight loss.</li>
<li>Since its inception, more than 10,000 individuals have been included in the Registry making it the largest longitudinal prospective study of successful weight loss practices.</li>
<li>To be eligible for inclusion, participants must be at least 18 years old and have maintained a minimum weight loss of 30 pounds for at least one year.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The NWCR has identified many dietary, physical activity, and behavioral strategies common among successful weight losers. Among these was the finding that Registry participants report a significantly high level of weekly physical activity.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall, more than 90% report exercise as crucial to their long-term weight-loss maintenance.</li>
<li>The caloric expenditure derived from physical activity averages nearly 2,700 kcal/wk among NWCR members.</li>
<li>This is equivalent to ~60-75 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per day or walking ~ 28 miles per week.</li>
<li>Walking is the most commonly reported mode of activity and resistance training is the second most commonly reported, with 52.2% and 29.2% of NWCR members reporting these activities, respectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goal-body-weight-calculations">Goal Body Weight Calculations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#goal-body-weight-calculations">#</a></h2>
<p>Many clients will have a goal focused on a weight loss outcome. As such, it may be useful to estimate a client&rsquo;s goal body weight for the purpose of goal-setting.</p>
<ul>
<li>A goal body weight may be calculated based on the client&rsquo;s:
<ul>
<li>current weight</li>
<li>current body composition</li>
<li>goal body composition</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1">Step 1<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-1">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Obtain the client&rsquo;s current body weight and body composition</strong> (or percent of body fat)</p>
<ul>
<li>Body composition analysis may be conducted using a variety of procedures including skinfold measurements</li>
<li>The assessment of body composition will be discussed in module number four</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2">Step 2<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-2">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Calculate the current fat weight</strong> (or pounds of fat) by multiplying the current total body weight by the current percent of body fat</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fat Weight = Total Body Weight x % Body Fat</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3">Step 3<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-3">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Calculate the client&rsquo;s current lean body weight</strong> by subtracting the current fat weight from the current total body weight</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lean Body Weight = Total Body Weight - Fat Weight</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4">Step 4<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-4">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Determine the client&rsquo;s goal percent of lean body weight</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In other words, if the client wishes to decrease the current percent of body fat, then what will be the corresponding percent of lean body weight?</li>
<li>The goal percent lean body weight is calculated by subtracting the goal percent body fat from 100%</li>
<li><strong>Goal % Lean Body Weight = 100% - Goal % Body Fat</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5">Step 5<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-5">#</a></h3>
<p>Overall weight loss is ideally accomplished by losing fat weight and at minimum by retaining the current lean body weight. Therefore, the fifth and final step is to:</p>
<p><strong>Divide the current lean body weight by the goal percent of lean body weight, which provides the estimated goal total body weight</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal Body Weight = Current LBW / Goal % LBW</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples">Examples<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#examples">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s perform a sample goal body weight calculation in the form of a multiple choice question.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A 40-year old female client currently weighs 170 pounds and has 32% body fat. She would like to decrease her body fat to 26% over the next six months. What is her goal body weight?</p>
<ul>
<li>A. 164 lbs</li>
<li>B. 156 lbs</li>
<li>C. 150 lbs</li>
<li>D. 144 lbs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, multiply her current body weight of 170 pounds by her current percent body fat of 32%</p>
<ul>
<li>This indicates that she currently has 54.4 pounds of fat weight</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, subtract the 54.4 pounds of fat weight from the total body weight of 170 pounds</p>
<ul>
<li>This indicates that she currently has 115.6 pounds of lean body weight</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since her goal is to improve her body composition to 26% fat, her goal percent lean body weight is 74%</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, the final step is to divide her current lean body weight of 115.6 by .74</li>
<li>This estimates her goal body weight at 26% body fat and 74% lean body weight to be 156 pounds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The correct answer above is “B”</p>
<p>170 lbs x 0.32 = 54.4 lbs of fat weight
170 lbs - 54.4 = 115.6 lbs of lean body weight
115.6 / 0.74 (goal % LBW) = 156 lbs (goal weight)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take look at another example&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>A male client currently weights 230 pounds and his body composition is 22% fat
<ul>
<li>
<p>230 pounds times 22% fat indicates his current fat weight is 50.6 pounds</p>
<ul>
<li><em>230 lbs x 0.22 = 50.6 lbs of fat weight</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since 50.6 pounds of his current weight is fat, the remaining 179.4 pounds represent lean body weight</p>
<ul>
<li>Likewise, since 22% of his current weight is fat, the remaining 78% is lean
<ul>
<li><em>230 lbs - 50.6 = 179.4 lbs of lean body weight</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>His goal is to reduce the percent body fat to 18%, while retaining his current lean body weight</p>
<ul>
<li>When he achieves the goal of 18% body fat, his current lean body weight will then represent 82% of his total body weight</li>
<li>Therefore, take the current lean body weight of 179.4 pounds and divide it by the goal percent of lean body weight, 82%
<ul>
<li><em>100% - 18% (goal body fat) = 82% (goal LBW)</em></li>
<li><em>179.4 (current LBW) / 0.82 (goal LBW) = 218 lbs (goal weight)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This reveals his goal body weight of 218.8 pounds, an overall weight loss of 11.2 pounds of fat from his current weight</p>
<ul>
<li>230 lbs x 0.22 = 50.6 lbs of fat weight</li>
<li>230 lbs - 50.6 = 179.4 lbs of lean body weight</li>
<li>179.4 / 0.82 (goal % LBW) = 218.8 lbs (goal weight)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
